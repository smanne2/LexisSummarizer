\"1984\" ad drew inspiration from the novel of the same name, presenting a dystopian future plagued by a lack of originality.\\', \\'A room full of people with shaved heads watch as a Big Brother figure preaches the benefits of \"unification of thought\" until a blonde woman dressed in orange shorts and a white tank top runs in and heaves a sledgehammer at the screen, which explodes to reveal

his 2013 book The Insanity of Advertising: Memoirs of a Madman, former Apple ad account manager Fred Goldberg said \"1984\" began as a rejected ad for the Apple III before it was selected as one of more than 40 possible spots to introduce the next computer, the Macintosh.\\', \\'Apple purchased a 60-second block of airtime and two 30-second spots to run during the Super Bowl, and produced 30-second and 60-second versions of the \"1984\" ad and another titled \"Alone Again\" for the Lisa business computer.\\', \\'The ad was directed by now-legendary filmmaker , then fresh off Blade Runner.\\', \\'Apple hired 300 extras, including some actual London skinheads and actress Anya Major to appear in the ad.\\', \\'In all, Apple spent $650,000 for \"1984\" and \"Alone Again\" by the time they were shown to the company\\\\\\'s board of directors for approval.\\', \\'A 30-second spot for Super Bowl XVIII cost $383,000.\\', \\'The same time slot for Super Bowl LII next month will cost advertisers more than $5 million.\\', \\'While Goldberg said Apple co-founder and CEO supported the \"1984\" ad, Apple\\\\\\'s board of directors were unimpressed and urged ad agency Chiat/Day to sell off the Super Bowl ad time it had bought.\\', \"The ad wasn\\'t a hit with preview audiences, either.\", \"Goldberg said the ad was tested by a leading market research firm and it received a score of 5 on ASI Market Research\\'s 43-point scale of effectiveness -- a fraction of the average score of 29.\", \"Ultimately, though, Goldberg chose not to share the test results and Chiat/Day was only able to sell half of Apple\\'s advertising time.\", \\'Instead of running 60 seconds of no content, Apple chose to air \"1984.\"\\', \"An ad revolution The game between the Raiders and Redskins was lopsided, but Apple\\'s ad made a splash -- and led to strong sales and influenced future Super Bowl ads.\", \\'Although the ambitious commercial ran only once, it created enough buzz that it was shown repeatedly on television news broadcasts in the following days.\\', \"Russell Winer, professor of Marketing at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said part of the ad\\'s success came from how it broke the mold, centering around product demonstrations and its cinematic depiction of a dystopian future.\", \\'\"The two things that really made it unique were the lack of any product demonstration, discussion of product features and what it could do, just the MacIntosh is coming and \\\\\\'1984 won\\\\\\'t be like 1984\\\\\\' and the execution itself which was pretty revolutionary,\" Winer told UPI.\\', \\'\"That was all brand new for the Super Bowl, which historically had never seen advertising with a combination of those two kinds of features.\"\\', \\'Winer said \"1984\" helped usher in the modern culture of Super Bowl advertising, where the ads can be almost as popular as the game.\\', \\'\"There\\\\\\'s always a lot of publicity before the Super Bowl, what ads are coming and trying to create excitement and buzz about the ads and that really started with the 1984 ad,\" he said.\\', \\'\"It may have been one of the first ads that actually got a lot of buzz without the existence of social media.\\', \\'It was pretty revolutionary no doubt.\"\\', \\'By branding itself as a creative and bold alternative to chief competitor IBM, Winer said Apple became one of the earliest company\\\\\\'s to adopt a now popular strategy of selling a \"brand story\" through advertising.\\', \\'\"It tried to demonstrate Apple\\\\\\'s innovativeness, edginess and obviously revolutionary ideas,\" he said.\\', \\'\"That\\\\\\'s an angle that\\\\\\'s often missed, this idea of brand stories which is very popular today in advertising to try to create a heritage for a brand and try to differentiate it from competitors in very competitive categories.\"\\', \\'Evolving the brand Much has changed since the \"1984\" ad aired 35 years ago, as Apple has become one of the most recognizable and profitable brands on the planet.\\', \"But in some ways, the iconic advertisement has remained a part of Apple\\'s identity.\", \\'Later Apple ads never again touched on the downtrodden, bleak future seen in the \"1984\" commercial.\\', \\'The company did, however, continue paving the way with highly unique advertising that focused on brand identity and its ever-growing status as a pop culture fixture.\\', \\'\"Apple has used the approach several times after that.\\', \\'They ran the \\\\\\'Think Different\\\\\\' campaign back in the 90s where they just showed pictures of famous celebrities, no product shots,\" said Winer.\\', \\'\"Then there was the Mac vs. PC campaign in the mid 2000s, again poking fun at the IBM PC, but more from the kind of person that would buy a PC as in a cool person would buy a Mac a nerd would buy a PC but again no product shots.\"\\', \\'In most of its successes, Apple has managed to recapture the innovative spirit of the Macintosh computer that allowed it to break into the global consciousness.\\', \\'\"Apple has just always stood for innovation,\" Winer said.\\', \\'\"That was Apple\\\\\\'s brand story and has been Apple\\\\\\'s brand story for a long time; innovating from the PCs, to the iPod, to the iPhone, the iPad, the watch and who knows what\\\\\\'s going to come later.\"\\', \\'In 2018, Apple reached a pinnacle by becoming the first publicly-traded company to reach a trillion-dollar market capitalization.\\', \\'But its new success has also come with new challenges as the 35th anniversary of the \"1984\" ad arrives.\\', \\'At the beginning of 2019, Apple lowered its revenue guidance for its first fiscal quarter, citing a range of issues -- including a weakening economy in China and lower than anticipated iPhone sales, both of which had been pivotal to its success in recent years.\\', \"The marketing landscape has also changed and the company\\'s own advertising has become more conservative

the proposal that President Trump put forth over the weekend to reopen the government and also provide $5.7 billion in border wall funding and then you would have a vote on a Democratic proposal to reopen the government.\\', \\'Obviously, no border wall funding there.\\', \"There\\'s another competing track going on right now in the House of Representatives.\", \\'The House rules committee is

would not necessarily sign.\\', \\'Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader in the Senate has said that President Trump would in fact sign the package in the Senate.\\', \"This is the narrative in Washington right now with the sides continued to talk past one another and that\\'s why nobody thinks that this government shutdown is any place -- anywhere in sight.\", \\'At the end of the day, today is the day that they had to start processing checks for federal workers to go out on Friday, so this is a real problem.\\', \"Even if they were to move this on Thursday there\\'s no way that

point.\", \\'Listen, in every shutdown we have seen the economy recapture.\\', \\'The issue now is the China trade fight is weighing on the Dow.\\', \\'The Dow is down today.\\', \"Chris, here\\'s the thing.\", \"Trump\\'s big mortal enemy is not just Pelosi or Schumer.\", \"It\\'s the courts.\", \\'The courts can make his offer move.\\', \"I mean, his offer to extend DACA by saying give me three more years is irrelevant because the courts say DACA protection stay in place for at least another year, and plus, SCOTUS won\\'t hear those lower court rulings blocking him on that.\", \\'The courts could step in again.\\', \\'CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER: But the president might have step in it with this one.\\', \"Because the courts, the Supreme Court doesn\\'t want to go and get ahead of the White House or get ahead of Congress.\", \\'They would rather see those branches figure out a deal on DACA before the court has to make a ruling.\\', \\'So, when over the weekend the president suggested as an offer a three-year extension of DACA.\\', \"That\\'s a very likely reason for why it appears that the court, the Supreme Court is not going to hear this case this time around.\", \\'If they did hear it, they very likely would give President Trump the ability to end DACA the way he has and that would make his bargaining position a lot stronger.\\', \"But him making an offer there to Congress that\\'s going to make the Supreme Court say hold on a second.\", \"Let\\'s let these two branches figure it out and if they really can\\'t they come back to us.\", \"But now it\\'s going to be a no next legislative session.\", \\'MACDONALD: Yes.\\', \\'Chris makes a good point here, Ford.\\', \\'I mean, the Supreme Court -- I mean, let me back up.\\', \"There\\'s been rulings that they really don\\'t like when you make executive -- you do executive actions to change policy.\", \\'They do want the Congress to hammer it out.\\', \"Let\\'s show how the courts are already blocking Trump on various ways.\", \"Ford, what\\'s at stake here if the Congress doesn\\'t act?\", \\'Do you think President Trump will break the glass and go to plan B and get Army Corps engineer money to build a wall?\\', \\'He could do it.\\', \"O\\'CONNELL: Well, I think that President Trump is definitely looking at different alternatives, whether it\\'s the national emergency or going to the Army Corps of Engineers and shuffling money over the wall.\", \\'But I think that President Trump recognizes that he has to make a good faith effort to the legislative system because we are really in unchartered territory.\\', \"And really what\\'s going on between McConnell, Pelosi, and Trump is something that the founding fathers did not think of and they wanted this to be done through legislation.\", \\'I think that President Trump understands that if he tries to do it through legislation the American public is much likely to be agreeable to him.\\', \\'MACDONALD: Yes, because the next president can always overturn executive actions.\\', \"That\\'s what Trump did with Obama.\", \\'You know, the Democrats are saying, Chris, that programs like DACA would not be in jeopardy if Trump had left them alone in the first place.\\', \"They\\'re saying why should Democrats trust Trump\\'s word when he\\'s already losing the battle in court.\", \"I mean, can\\'t they get a bipartisan solution like Bill Clinton did with police funding in the early 90\\'s and everybody says hey, we want it.\", \"It\\'s a victory for everybody.\", \"BEDFORD: Maybe back in the 1990\\'s, absolutely.\", \"But the bottom line problem that they\\'re reaching is that President Trump was elected by on a promise that he would build a wall and the Democrats were elected on the promise they would resist.\", \"They can\\'t come -- you can\\'t come to the compromise table when one person says wall and the other persons says resist.\", \"And really it doesn\\'t matter.\", \"That almost every single one of President Trump\\'s deals alienate the conservative base because they think it\\'s giving too much to Democrats.\", \"The Democrats can\\'t accept things that they have voted for in the past.\", \\'MACDONALD: OK. BEDFORD: Because if they did do that it would be a political suicide for them.\\', \\'MACDONALD: Watch him break the glass.\\', \\'He could do Army Corps of Engineer money -- (CROSSTALK) BEDFORD: He might.\\', \"MACDONALD: -- in spending or -- O\\'CONNELL: Yes.\", \\'MACDONALD: Chris and Ford, you are going to be back with us in just a bit.\\', \\'We got breaking news.\\', \\'Arrivals are back on at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey after a ground stop due to drone activity.\\', \\'Remember we brought you that story what was going on in Gatwick Airport in England.\\', \\'Now some flights are reportedly being held at their destinations before departing in order to slow the pace of incoming traffic.\\', \\'A drone stopped air traffic at Newark international.\\', \"It\\'s a story that happened in England.\", \"It\\'s happening here now in the United States.\", \"That\\'s breaking news.\", \"We\\'re going to stay on that story for you.\", \"Let\\'s get to your money.\", \\'Stocks across the board selling off.\\', \\'Jitters over global growth and trade.\\', \\'The Dow closing down sharply.\\', \\'It was well off of session lows, though.\\', \\'Gerri Willis has more from the New York Stock Exchange.\\', \\'Gerri?\\', \\'GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hi, there, Liz.\\', \"That\\'s right.\", \\'This was it could have been worse trading session.\\', \\'The Dow ending up 301 points down or 1.2 percent.\\', \\'The S&P 500 down 37 points or 1.42 percent.\\', \\'The NASDAQ down more than 2 percent.\\', \"And at one point today the Dow was down about 450 points, so it could\\'ve been much, much worse.\", \\'Why were the stocks trading lower?\\', \\'Well, it was all about China and trade worries and concerns about trade.\\', \\'But also, this was the first day that traders down here had an opportunity to trade on the news that China growth is stalling.\\', \\'As you know, we had a report late last week the China growth now 6.6 percent.\\', \\'This probably sounds pretty good to your viewers with a long-term average for China growth is something like 10 percent.\\', \\'So, this is really a step back.\\', \\'But overall, the markets not in positive territory but a lot of people they are more too upset this afternoon.\\', \\'Liz, back to you.\\', \\'MACDONALD: Thank you, Gerri Willis.\\', \\'Later in the show, U.S. and China trade talk sill on rocky terms after China threatens to walk if Huawei CFO is not released.\\', \\'We are going to tell you who will link first.\\', \\'But first, Alexandria Cortez says capitalism is immoral because it creates billionaires.\\', \"Didn\\'t bring up the billionaires funding the Democrat Party or that swing Denmark, Finland say their capitalist pays for socialist programs.\", \\'We are going to sit down with billionaire Ernie Boch to talk about this claim.\\', \"We\\'re going to talk also about how you don\\'t hear about the billionaires in Russia, Venezuela and elsewhere of the communist states.\", \"That\\'s coming up.\", \\'Stay right there.\\', \\'MACDONALD: Democrat socialist Alexandria Cortez says capitalism is immoral because it created billionaires alongside those living in extreme poverty.\\', \"(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

\\'MACDONALD: A powerful but little known law that the Trump administration is using to build the border wall is giving civil libertarians nightmares.\\', \"It\\'s called the Real ID Act that was passed in 2005 at the height of the war on terror.\", \\'It gives any administration, Democrat or Republican, vast and arbitrary powers to waive any law that stands in the way of any construction on the border.\\', \\'But do we want so much power in the hands of the federal government, meaning any administration that could oversee it, Democrat or Republican?\\', \"Let\\'s bring back Ford O\\'Connell and Christopher Bedford.\", \"Chris, no matter if it\\'s Democrat or Republican, that\\'s a lot of power.\", \\'CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION: It is a lot of power.\\', \\'Unfortunately, another group that has a lot of power are the environmental activists to the point that they can stop you from digging a well, building a bar or building a wall.\\', \\'They can stop you from really anything.\\', \"Environmental activists get a hold of you, that you\\'re something that they want to disrupt.\", \"They can tie you up in court and basically -- MACDONALD: That\\'s a good point.\", \\'BEDFORD: -- almost any kind of construction that you want to do.\\', \\'So the fact that building this wall could violate 25, 26 laws, that shows you how

\"O\\'CONNELL: One other thing.\", \\'We already have 650 plus miles of border barriers.\\', \\'Trust me, Xavier Becerra, the A.G. of California, will be trying to knock down the barriers that we do

abused.\", \"MACDONALD: OK, I hear what you\\'re saying.\", \\'It gives Homeland Security authority.\\', \\'I think the Homeland Security secretary already overturned 20 laws to get barriers built and

the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act.\\', \"Chris, I\\'m just pushing back on you to get a debate going.\", \\'I am interested in this because I am listening to what civil libertarians are saying.\\', \\'Go ahead, Chris.\\', \\'BEDFORD: Civil libertarians have some real serious complaints there like the the fact the federal government can seize private land to build this wall.\\', \"That\\'s an issue.\", \"But the fact that the environmental groups and the activists are so able to hamper any kind of movement that an administration does, that the private owner does, that\\'s a

actually buying into this nonsense.\\', \\'MACDONALD: Chris, what do you think of the ad?\\', \"BEDFORD: It\\'s funny for Gillette to weigh into it because most social justice warriors either don\\'t

you seen?\\', \\'PINSKER: It is pretty horrifying.\\', \\'The problem is that because were are not securing the border, the cartels have taken over and they taken their notes from ISIS when it comes to brutalizing, torturing, even murdering people on both sides of the border.\\', \\'MACDONALD: Like what?\\', \\'Can you tell us -- can you give us some cases?\\', \\'PINSKER: Absolutely.\\', \\'I can tell you how they abducted an innocent person, took him up to the border, put drugs on him, ordered him to cross the border illegally.\\', \\'When he refused, they stabbed him in the gut.\\', \\'I know this because in court, he lifted his shirt up and showed where the stab wound was.\\', \\'I want to keep it P.G.\\', \\'here.\\', \"I\\'ve seen graphic things.\", \"I\\'ve seen people in court, people covered in torture marks, rather been cut to pieces or just burned or having hot oil poured over their head.\", \"It\\'s brutal.\", \\'This is happening right here on both sides of the border because the cartels have completely taken over.\\', \\'MACDONALD: And also child trafficking too and human trafficking, right?\\', \\'PINSKER: Absolutely 99.9 percent of all people illegally entering the country are forced to pay the cartels a fee of about $6,000 to $8,000 to cross into the country.\\', \"Illegal immigration is not just people trying to come into the country, it\\'s human trafficking.\", \"Again, it\\'s controlled by the cartels.\", \\'MACDONALD: Go ahead.\\', \"You make a commonsense point that of course they\\'re trying to cross illegally because a lot of these illegals -- not a lot, let me back up, some of these illegals have criminal records, so they got to cross illegally, right?\", \\'PINSKER: Absolutely.\\', \\'I did a study and took sample size of 656 illegal aliens I prosecuted.\\', \\'One in three of them had a criminal record.\\', \\'Now, why are they entering illegally?\\', \"Because of their criminal background, because they\\'re danger to America.\", \\'They are unable to enter legally.\\', \"They can\\'t enter legally.\", \"So, that\\'s what they do.\", \\'They pay the cartels a lot of money so they can be trafficked in illegally.\\', \\'I can tell the American people, I personally prosecuted multiple child molesters, rapists, murderers.\\', \"We hear stories from politicians in D.C. that it\\'s just a bunch of good, honest people looking for work.\", \\'Yes, no star, but there is still a significant number.\\', \\'One in three had a criminal record.\\', \\'One in three people have criminal records in the U.S., many others have criminal records in their country of origin, which is why they are escaping their countries for a fresh start elsewhere.\\', \\'MACDONALD: Understood.\\', \\'So do walls work?\\', \\'PINSKER: Absolutely.\\', \\'Let me tell you a story.\\', \\'Where I was about 200 miles off border, a single mile of border wall was erected on a community college campus just 150 yards from the border itself.\\', \"That campus before the wall was having multiple times a week illegal aliens crossing across campus creating problems as well as cartels making major drug deals on the college\\'s tennis courts.\", \\'What did they do?\\', \\'They built just a one-mile wall.\\', \\'They only did it to reduce everything, not just reduce, almost completely stopped it.\\', \\'It made it much more -- made border patrol able to do their job.\\', \\'It created a natural checkpoints at both ends of the wall where they could more easily catch people.\\', \"When people -- when they went around it, when people try to go over the wall, again, it\\'s only an 8-foot fence, but that\\'s all they need.\", \\'It turned what used to be near misses into near hits to arrest people.\\', \"There are many people, millions of people probably in America right now where border patrol just had a couple of extra minutes because of a wall, they they would\\'ve been apprehended, they would\\'ve been arrested for illegal entering.\", \\'MACDONALD: You are saying the border wall slows them down.\\', \\'I mean -- PINSKER: Absolutely.\\', \"MACDONALD: The question is, I mean, if the border wall is immoral as Nancy Pelosi said -- PINSKER: Oh, that\\'s ridiculous.\", \"MACDONALD: Why don\\'t the Democrats take down their barrier fence that they said yes, build.\", \"PINSKER: You know, if it\\'s immoral, why are all these Democrats living in houses and gated communities?\", \"It\\'s hypocrisy.\", \\'Look, they enjoy security because there are walls at their houses.\\', \\'This community college proved that walls work.\\', \\'I just want the rest of America to have the same benefits as community college or these rich politicians behind their gated communities.\\', \\'MACDONALD: Matt Pinsker, former federal prosecutor.\\', \\'Thanks for coming in, sir.\\', \\'Great to see you.\\', \\'PINSKER: Thank you for having me on.\\', \\'MACDONALD: And thank you so much for having us in your home.\\', \\'We had a jam- packed hour.\\', \\'We are seeing on these votes in the Senate that may reopen the government and may not.\\', \\'We are going to stay on that story for you.\\', \\'Thank you so much for

nine Super Bowls in metropolitan areas with new stadiums in the past 15 years: Detroit, Phoenix, Dallas, Indianapolis, New York, San Francisco, Minneapolis and, now, Atlanta.\", \\'Arizona and Houston actually have hosted twice, but obviously neither of those buildings was new the second time around.\\', \"There\\'s nothing written on a game plan sheet guaranteeing such an award from the NFL,

weather, including ice storms that nearly shut down the city.\\', \"The NFL didn\\'t go back until this year, in part because the Georgia Dome no longer was a state-of-the-art venue, and in part

that we don\\'t play a Super Bowl in the first year after a building opens is you understand and learn from the events and the games in there.\", \\'One of the positives is a number of the key vendors who work on the Super Bowl work on other major events.\\', \"Clearly, in this community it\\'s a really collaborative spirit.\", \"\\'Of course, hosting a Super Bowl is about a lot more than

embarrassed despite putting up a very strong presentation, and that a lengthy series of ballots doesn\\'t look good for anyone.\", \"Now, O\\'Reilly and the owners\\' Super Bowl committee go to each club seeking an expression of interest in hosting the game.\", \"Many cities know they have no chance, perhaps because of weather concerns at an outdoor stadium — it\\'s unlikely any such venue in the Northeast except MetLife would be considered — or lack of stadium size or insufficient infrastructure or hotel space.\", \\'The committee identifies a city that fits best for a particular year and asks it for specifics for hosting.\\', \"\\'We end up with optimizing the sequences, avoid a scenario where multiple cities are spending significant time and resources on a bid and ultimately they\\'re not rewarded,\\' O\\'Reilly says.Suggestions that the game could wind up in London seem farfetched, and the NFL certainly would need a franchise there before it could happen.\", \\'Besides, Ganis says there will never be a shortage of U.S. locales interested in hosting.\\', \"\\'I focus on the tremendous amount of new money coming into the community, and not just the week of the Super

Zuerlein\\'s money-in-the bank, 57-yard field goal in overtime to airmail the Rams to Super Bowl LIII.\", \"Saints fans were left stunned as Zuerlein\\'s kick -- off a bad snap -- came just minutes after Saints quarterback Drew Brees was hit by Dante Fowler Jr. on a wobbly lob that wound up in the arms of safety John Johnson.\", \\'Trailing the entire way, the resilient Rams now make Jared Goff the youngest NFC quarterback in NFL lore to reach the big game.\\', \\'2.\\', \\'So how did we get to overtime -- and this stunning loss for the Saints?\\', \\'After digging themselves out of a 14-0 hole last week against the Eagles, New Orleans on Sunday never trailed until the final play.\\', \\'Still, they hardly operated at the height of their powers.\\', \"After teaming with Los Angeles for 80 points in their Week 9 tussle, Sunday\\'s showdown felt comparatively formless for minutes at a time.\", \\'The Saints built a 20-10 advantage midway through the third quarter when Brees (with 249 yards and two scores) hit the ultra-dynamic Taysom Hill for a 2-yard touchdown on a drive that saw Alvin Kamara punch through Los Angeles for 34 yards off four grabs.\\', \\'It felt as if the home-team Saints might pull away from there, but the Rams defense refused to die -- helped along the way by a play that will be discussed for months.\\', \\'With the game tied 20-20 at the two-minute warning, Brees airmailed a 43-yard bomb to Ted Ginn to the Los Angeles 13.\\', \\'The crowd melted seconds later -- on third-and-10 from that same spot -- when Rams corner Nickell Robey-Coleman was somehow not flagged on a pass breakup that saw him clearly collide with wideout Tommylee Lewis.\\', \\'Robey-Coleman was fortunate, but he likely could have pulled down an interception had he turned to see the ball.\\', \"It\\'s also fair to wonder if New Orleans would have been in that situation to begin with had coach Sean Payton done a better job with clock management.\", \\'3.\\', \\'The Rams showed their own brand of fight, overcoming a mistake-prone, out-of-sync start to go punch-for-punch with the Saints down the stretch.\\', \\'A collection of big-money plays led the way: » Los Angeles finally quelled the Superdome noise early in the second quarter when coach Sean McVay and special teams coordinator John \"Bones\" Fassel dialed up a fake punt that saw Johnny Hekker peg Sam Shields on a catch-and-run that kept the march alive.\\', \\'» That series ended with a field goal, but Goff spun hope two drives later with a beautiful 36-yard, over-the-shoulder dart to Brandin Cooks to set up a 6-yard scoring burst by Todd Gurley to cut the New Orleans lead to 13-10 before the half.\\', \\'» Down 20-17 in the fourth, Goff hit tight end Gerald Everett for a catch-and-rumble 39 yards before unfurling a 33-yard lob to Josh Reynolds to set up a field goal that triggered a 20-20 tie with five minutes to play.\\', \\'Later faced with fourth-and-goal from the New Orleans 1, McVay opted for the kick.\\', \\'Would he have done so if a different version of Gurley were waiting in the wings?\\', \\'More on that below.\\', \\'» Down 23-20 with the game on the line, Goff was money hitting Reynolds for 19 yards before Woods made a leaping grab for 16 yards to put the ball at the New Orleans 33.\\', \"Goff panicked on third down by unfurling a quick incompletion, but Zuerlein\\'s wavering-but-successful 48-yard game-tying kick sent the game into a fifth period .\", \\'» Come overtime, Goff -- to me -- appeared more at home in the Superdome, sensing pressure and finding tight end Tyler Higbee on a handful of game-changing completions.\\', \\'4.\\', \\'Get ready for two weeks of breathless coverage around Gurley, who finished with just 10 yards off four totes.\\', \\'His touchdown gallop failed to mask over an otherwise ugly afternoon.\\', \\'It began when Saints linebacker Demario Davis got the best of Gurley early, stuffing the runner for a loss on his first carry before turning a dropped pass by the star back into a killer pick of Goff.\\', \"Gurley\\'s ups and downs quickly became a narrative as cameras showed him nestled on the sideline as McVay used C.J.\", \\'Anderson (16/44) on the ground for long chunks of time.\\', \\'Gurley buzz-killed a subsequent series with another drop on a key third down in the red zone before also appearing to miss a block on a Goff incompletion.\\', \\'The bright spot here is a Rams offense that just beat the Saints with their best player operating as a non-factor.\\', \"They\\'ll need Gurley at his best, though, two Sundays from now.\", \\'5.\\', \"The Rams\\' defense deserves credit for holding the Saints to a pair of field goals out of the gate, especially when that Davis interception set New Orleans up at the Los Angeles 16-yard line.\", \"Ndamukong Suh followed up last week\\'s blue-ribbon effort with a strong outing against the run and 1.5 game-changing sacks.\", \"Aaron Donald didn\\'t light up the box score, but showed flashes of dominance in the second half.\", \\'6.\\', \\'Davis and Cam Jordan helped a Saints defense that gave the offense a chance to win and drew energy from a home crowd that operated at a fever pitch.\\', \"McVay called it the most noisome throng in memory, while the FOX broadcast showed Los Angeles equipment staffers feverishly working on the communication technology inside Goff\\'s helmet.\", \"The Rams also struggled to call plays in the huddle, but McVay\\'s boys ultimately found a way out of this madness.\", \\'7.\\', \\'With veteran Saints tight end Ben Watson out of the lineup battling appendicitis, Payton could only watch as reserve Dan Arnold dropped a would-be touchdown.\\', \"A fellow reserve stepped up two drives later, though, as tight end Garrett Griffin hauled in the game\\'s first score.\", \"That was made possible when Michael Brockers was flagged for encroachment on fourth-and-2 from the Rams\\' 10.\", \\'8.\\', \"Michael Thomas set a Saints single-game record with 211 receiving yards in the team\\'s Week 9 win over the Rams -- and carried New Orleans in last week\\'s win over the Eagles.\", \\'On Sunday, facing variations of Aqib Talib and Marcus Peters, Thomas finished with just 36 yards off four grabs.\\', \\'It was Kamara who paced the Saints with 96 yards off 11 grabs, but the big plays to Thomas were sorely missed.\\', \\'In case of any query regarding this article or other content please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\\']': 23.21516780473631,\n",

as a drop of 0.1 percent off GDP per week as the shutdown continues.\\', \"Now, part of the effect and the expected effect is due to federal workers, who are bracing now for a second missed paycheck

fixed at the price last spring.\\', \"So it\\'s about a half a percent lower.\", \"Once the shutdown comes to fruition, that 20 percent lagging that we were just talking about, that\\'s going to get done.\", \"Also, I don\\'t really care about the International Monetary Fund bringing down global growth from 3.7 to 3.5.\", \"That\\'s still a positive 3.5.\", \"My hope -- and I know that sounds

shutdown gets in the way of that.\\', \\'KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS HOLDINGS: Yes.\\', \\'CAVUTO: The shutdown gets in the way of closing home loans, because the FHA that backs a

that most investors kind of properly in the beginning dismissed, maybe not so much now?\\', \"ROONEY VERA: Neil, let\\'s look at the numbers, just kind of very easy, back of the envelope, because when the audience hears economists say this is going to shave off X Y, Z amount of points, it\\'s very -- quite a simple calculation.\", \\'Just so everyone knows, 20 percent of GDP goes -- is government spending, of which 20 percent is unfunded right now.\\', \"So it\\'s a partial government shutdown.\", \\'It does have an impact.\\', \\'By my own calculation, Neil, it will take 1 percentage point of GDP if it lasts for the entirety of the year.\\', \"So, of course, the duration of the shutdown is equivalent -- is going to -- it\\'s going to be the main influencer of how much this affects GDP,

guest\\'s comments.\", \\'I agree with him.\\', \\'I think that if this combination of negative forces continues to weigh on consumer sentiment and small business sentiment, then you can have the following happen, self- fulfilling prophecy.\\', \\'Guys get scared.\\', \"They say, I\\'m not going to buy that house.\", \"I\\'m not going to buy that car.\", \\'And that slows down economic activity.\\', \"So that\\'s where I\\'m starting to really get cautious.\", \"The numbers are strong, and I do agree it\\'s still an opportunity to buy, because this market fall is based on fear.\",

with this.\\', \\'Can you?\\', \\'CHRIS ROBINSON, CME TRADER: Oh, absolutely.\\', \\'I mean, this is where the rubber meets the road as far as risk management is.\\', \\'Right behind me, they trade a million-seven contracts of (INAUDIBLE) very day.\\', \\'One contract covers $130,000 worth of stocks.\\', \"So people don\\'t necessarily have to be wondering, where\\'s the bottom, how can I get out?\", \\'This is why this place is here.\\', \"Now, the stock market\\'s closed, but the futures market is continuing to go.\", \\'It will trade all night long.\\', \"And I don\\'t think to have -- we had 17 days in a row where we rallied.\", \\'We were up over 15 percent, close to 15 percent.\\', \\'CAVUTO: Very true.\\', \\'ROBINSON: So, today, we dropped 50 points in the S&P.\\', \"That\\'s not that big a percentage drop.\", \\'We could drop further and still be OK.\\', \"But I think that\\'s what people didn\\'t like today was the news that we may have hit a bump in the trade negotiations with China, number one, and also you saw us turn lower after the housing information came out.\", \"CAVUTO: All right, real quickly, Lee Munson, another factor is China, on- again/off-again talk, that maybe the talks aren\\'t going to happen or that there might be a hissy fit between Washington and Beijing.\", \"I don\\'t know where that stands.\", \\'But it seems like the talks are on, people optimistic a deal can be had.\\', \\'Are you?\\', \\'MUNSON: I am optimistic.\\', \"Here\\'s the thing.\", \\'We already know that China was soft last year.\\', \\'Its own

England Patriots to go to their ninth Super Bowl with Brady and Coach Bill Belichick era.\\', \\'The NFC Championship Game was just as compelling, as the Rams advanced to the Super Bowl with a 26-23 overtime victory, and the Saints were robbed by the officials on the missed pass interference call on Nickell Robey-Coleman.\\', \\'The victories set up a very compelling Super Bowl matchup that in many ways will be painted as young (Rams quarterback Jared Goff and Coach Sean McVay) versus old (Brady and Belichick).\\', \\'But there are also many similarities between the two teams, and while some reasons for their success are obvious — Brady and Belichick are all-time greats, while McVay is considered perhaps the brightest young mind in the game — others are a little more hidden.\\', \"As the NFL\\'s other 30 teams make their offseason changes, they would be wise to learn from these lessons from the Super Bowl participants.\", \"Lesson 1: Don\\'t shy away from making trades Over the past several years, the Patriots have been one of the most aggressive teams in the league as it pertains to making trades.\", \\'Knowing the difficulty of getting rookies to play at a championship level, Belichick has mastered the strategy of trading for players in the third and fourth years of their rookie contracts.\\', \\'The Patriots traded for left tackle Trent Brown, Cordarrelle Patterson, Danny Shelton and Jason McCourty this offseason.\\', \\'Last offseason, he traded for wide receiver Brandin Cooks, before dealing him to the Rams this April.\\', \"Part of the Rams\\' championship blueprint has been built through the trades of General Manager Les Snead, who dealt for cornerbacks Marcus Peters and Aqib Talib along with Cooks this offseason.\", \"He didn\\'t stop there, acquiring edge rusher Dante Fowler Jr. from Jacksonville at the trade deadline.\", \"All have played pivotal roles this season, with Fowler making the hit on Brees that forced the overtime interception that set up Greg Zuerlein\\'s game-winning field goal.\", \\'Lesson 2: Place a high value on offensive line play, and coaching According to Pro Football Focus, the four conference finalists ranked among the top 11 for offensive line play, with the Patriots ranking third and the Rams seventh.\\', \\'Los Angeles rebuilt its line with the additions last offseason of left tackle Andrew Whitworth and center John Sullivan — the two positions that most GMs around the league will tell you are the most important on any line.\\', \"O-line coach Aaron Kromer is a valuable asset, as he picked up on how the Dallas Cowboys were tipping off their stunts and blitzes by the way they lined up before the snap in last week\\'s divisional-round matchup.\", \\'The Patriots may not have any big names along their line, but offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia is one of the all-time best.\\', \\'His aggressive blocking scheme against the Los Angeles Chargers played a big role in that victory, and the work of Brown at left tackle since coming over in a trade with the 49ers has been impressive.\\', \\'New England lost Nate Solder in free agency, and then first-round pick Isaiah Wynn to injury before the season began, and still found a way to build a very effective front wall for Brady and the running game.\\', \\'Lesson 3: In an offense-heavy game, the teams with the best playcallers rose to the top Clearly, NFL teams are aware of the success of McVay, who has been held up as the modern prototype for the role.\\', \"But it\\'s still worth noting that of the four conference finalists, each had a playcaller considered one of the best in the game: McVay, Payton, Andy Reid and Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.\", \"The league\\'s rule changes gave the offense a decided advantage, and the four highest-scoring teams in the league wound up playing for Super Bowl appearances on Sunday.\", \\'With that unlikely to change next season, any team with a serious shot at contending is going to need to put a high-scoring offense on the field.\\', \"All four of the conference finalists had a 4,000-yard passer, with the exception of Brees, who came up 28 yards short after resting the team\\'s season finale.\", \\'Lesson 4: Go for it on fourth down Interestingly, McVay went against his usual formula by opting for a chip-shot field goal to tie the NFC title game at 20-20 in the fourth quarter Sunday, instead of going for the touchdown and the lead.\\', \\'It all ended up working out, but had the Saints gone on to win in regulation, that would have been a heavily scrutinized decision.\\', \\'Still, the Rams and Patriots (in addition to the Saints and Chiefs) deserve credit for embracing the analytics movement and being aggressive in going for it on fourth down.\\', \\'The four teams were a combined 38 of 60 on fourth-down attempts, converting 63.3 percent — well above the league average of 55.7 percent.\\', \"The Rams essentially iced their win over Dallas in the divisional round with McVay\\'s decision to go for it on fourth and goal.\", \"The Chiefs did make a critical fourth-and-1 stop of New England in Sunday\\'s game, but generally speaking, fortune has favored the teams willing to go for it on fourth down this season.\", \\'Lesson 5: A strong running game still matters The Rams and Patriots both ranked in the top five of the NFL in rushing yards per game this season.\\', \"Their ground success was readily apparent in both teams\\' divisional-round wins, and while the Saints largely bottled up the Rams on the ground Sunday, the Patriots put up 176 rushing yards and four touchdowns against Kansas City, with the running game proving pivotal in building a 14-0 first-half lead.\", \"For L.A., the running game — usually led by Todd Gurley, who was limited in Sunday\\'s win — is also a huge factor in setting up the play-action pass, including through the use of jet sweeps and other motion that McVay has become known for as a playcaller.\", \\'The Patriots also ask a lot of their running backs in the passing game, with McDaniels finding creative ways to get them the ball out of the backfield.\\', \\'Even though this was an NFL season defined by big plays in the passing game, teams that can win on the ground set themselves up for success.\\', \\'Graphic Associated Press Los Angeles Rams kicker Greg

after the game, Anderson went to Twitter, writing \"3 championship Sunday 3-0 see you in ATL.\"\\', \\'On Monday night, Anderson spoke with the Times-Herald by phone.\\', \\'\"This is the third time I\\\\\\'m headed to the Super Bowl, but I think the feeling stays the same,\" Anderson said.\\', \\'\"The NFC Championship feels just the same as the AFC Championship and getting to play in another

released by three teams in 2018 (Denver, Carolina, Oakland) Anderson has found a home in Los Angeles after being signed on Dec. 19.\\', \\'The Cal graduate rushed for over 100 yards in his first three games with the Rams, all wins, before leading the team in carries and yards on Sunday in New Orleans.\\', \\'On Sunday, Anderson had a bulk of the carries rather than teammate Todd Gurley.\\', \\'\"That was just the feel for the flow of the game that we had, not anything against Todd,\" Rams head coach Sean McVay said.\\', \\'\"C.J.\\', \\'did a nice job, but I thought they did a good job as a whole, slowing down our run game, and we had to grind some things out.\"\\', \"Gurley, who missed the final two regular-season games because of a knee injury, indicated that he had not been

shined a lot more in 2016 in Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara when he helped the Denver Broncos defeat the Carolina Panthers 24-10.\\', \\'In that game Anderson scored a touchdown and had 90 yards on 23 carries.\\', \\'He was released early in 2018 by the Broncos, even though he rushed for over 1,000 yards in the 2017-18 season.\\', \"He signed a deal with the Carolina Panthers in early May, but

in his only week with the team.\\', \"Anderson, however, has fit into the Rams\\' offense well.\", \\'\"Sometimes, it\\\\\\'s just all about timing and opportunity.\\', \\'Even after it didn\\\\\\'t work out with the Raiders I never put my head down,\" Anderson told the Times-Herald in December.\\', \\'\"And now I\\\\\\'m just grateful and gracious for the opportunity that was presented to me by Coach (Sean) McVay at the right time.\"\\', \"The outcome of Sunday\\'s NFC championship might not have been possible without an egregious mistake by the officials in the closing minutes of regulation.\", \"Los Angeles cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman committed a blatant interference penalty with a helmet-to-helmet hit on Tommylee Lewis well before the pass arrived inside the 5, forcing the Saints to settle for Wil Lutz\\'s 31-yard field goal that made it 23-20 with 1:41 left in regulation.\", \\'\"Came to the sideline, looked at the football gods and was like, \\\\\\'Thank you,\\\\\\'\" Robey-Coleman said.\\', \\'\"I got away with one tonight.\"\\', \"After the no-call, Jared Goff had enough time to lead the Rams down the field for Zuerlein\\'s tying field goal, a 48-yarder with 15 seconds remaining.\", \\'New Orleans won the coin toss and got the ball first in overtime.\\', \\'But, with Dante Fowler Jr. in his face and striking his arm, Drew Brees fluttered up a pass that was picked off by John Johnson III, who was able to hang on to the interception while stumbling backward.\\', \\'Johnson hopped up and celebrated by doing with the \"Choppa Style\" dance popularized by New Orleans rapper Choppa, whose namesake song had become a Saints\\\\\\' rallying cry and was even performed during the halftime show.\\', \"The Rams weren\\'t able to do much offensively, but it didn\\'t matter.\", \\'Zuerlein booted through the winning field goal from just inside midfield with plenty of room to spare.\\', \\'The NFL said it the longest game-winning kick in playoff history.\\', \\'\"It\\\\\\'s unbelievable, man.\\', \\'I can\\\\\\'t put it into words,\" said Goff, who at 24 became the youngest quarterback to win an NFC title.\\', \\'\"The defense played the way they did to force it to overtime.\\', \\'The defense gets a pick and Greg makes a 57-yarder to win it.\\', \\'That was good from about 70.\\', \\'Unbelievable.\"\\', \\'The Superdome, which had been in uproar all afternoon, suddenly turned eerily silent.\\', \\'It was the first home playoff loss for the Saints with Brees and coach Sean Payton, who and been 6-0 in those games since their pairing began in 2006.\\', \\'This one really hurt.\\', \"If the pass interference penalty had been called, the Saints could\\'ve run most of the time off the clock to set up a winning field goal from chip-shot range.\", \\'\"Being that it happened right there in front of the person who would be the one to make the call, and everyone in the stands saw it, everyone watching at home on TV saw it, that makes it even more difficult to take,\" Brees said.\\', \\'\"Because of this, I\\\\\\'m sure there will be a lot of talk about reviewing penalties, perhaps game-changing penalties.\"\\', \\'The Rams (15-3) and McVay, capped a remarkable rise since moving back to Los Angeles three years ago.\\', \\'The team will be appearing in its first Super Bowl since the 2001 season, when the \"Greatest Show on Turf\" was still in St. Louis.\\', \"The team hasn\\'t won an NFL title in Los Angeles since 1951, well before the Super Bowl era.\", \\'The team moved to St. Louis in 1995, only to return to Southern California two decades later.\\', \\'\"Shoot, I don\\\\\\'t even know what day it is,\" McVay said.\\', \\'\"All I know is we\\\\\\'re NFC champs, baby!\"\\', \\'Payton said he

interception when Todd Gurley let a pass slip through his hands.\\', \\'Then a fake punt early in the second quarter gave Los Angeles its initial first down of the game.\\', \\'Sparked by that gutsy call, the Rams finally came to life offensively and drove into position for the first of four field goals by Zuerlein.\\', \\'Gurley made it 13-10 at halftime on a 6-yard touchdown run just before the

Let\\'s also -- we can also look nationally.\", \\'And we see pretty much the exact same thing.\\', \\'If you -- if you know who Harris is, do you have a favorable or unfavorable rating of her?\\', \\'Ninety-one percent said they had a favorable rating of Senator Harris.\\', \\'That is quite, quite high, right near the top of the field.\\', \\'JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: In the sports business we call that a high upside.\\', \"In other words, if she introduces herself in this way to the rest of the people who don\\'t know her, it shows where -- how high she can grow.\", \"ENTEN: That\\'s exactly right.\", \"And, indeed, you know, if you look at Senator Harris and you\\'re trying to build, you know, almost the perfect Democratic candidate, if you look at the trends in the Democratic Party, you\\'d want someone who\\'s liberal.\", \\'Her record in the Senate is quite liberal.\\', \\'We know that women have been doing very well in the 2016 primaries and especially in the 2018 primaries.\\', \"She\\'s obviously a woman.\", \\'African- Americans play a major role in Democratic primaries throughout the country.\\', \\'And we know, of course, that Kamala Harris is half African- American.\\', \\'So she basically has a lot of things and I think these early numbers that you see of people who know who she is are indicative of this strategic path.\\', \"ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: And so you\\'re saying that that favorable number is higher than the people who have -- who are rating higher in the polls, such as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?\", \"ENTEN: They\\'re certainly higher than Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\", \"They\\'re right around where Joe Biden is.\", \\'And so, you know, we have Biden at number three.\\', \\'We have her a little bit higher because we think that as the field and the campaigns develops, that she will get a real boost in her numbers.\\', \"BERMAN: Now, one of the interesting things -- and we don\\'t know this for sure -- but you hear from the Harris people, the way she may approach the primary season is to compete in Iowa and New Hampshire, but South Carolina, which is the third state to hold voting -- actually I don\\'t know where Nevada is.\", \"So South Carolina\\'s early, but that South Carolina is where she wants to make the biggest impact.\", \\'You think there could be a problem there?\\', \\'ENTEN: I do think that there could be a problem there.\\', \\'So, you know, if we were to look, for instance, here.\\', \\'And what we can see is, in Iowa and New Hampshire, you know, we always say those are the big contests that we look forward to.\\', \\'And part of the reason that is, is because if we go back since 1972 and we say, OK, if there is no incumbent running in that particular primary, how do the candidates do in Iowa and New Hampshire?\\', \\'And we know that all 16 nominees who came out of those primaries did second or better in at least Iowa or New Hampshire.\\', \\'And in 14 of 16, they won Iowa or New Hampshire.\\', \\'You have to play in those states.\\', \\'Remember John Glenn in 1984.\\', \"I wasn\\'t alive for that, but, you know, I read about these things.\", \"Or remember Rudy Giuliani, I\\'m going to go to Florida to make a big stink there and, you know, blah, blah, blah, forget Iowa and New Hampshire.\", \\'It just has not worked in the past.\\', \"That\\'s not to say you can\\'t go to South Carolina and play, you know, put yourself in a position to win there.\", \\'You obviously want to plan ahead.\\', \\'But you have to at least show up and do partially decent in Iowa and New Hampshire if you want to win the nomination.\\', \\'CAMEROTA: All right.\\', \\'So what are your other -- ENTEN: Well, I would just -- CAMEROTA: Showing us in early states.\\', \\'ENTEN: Right.\\', \\'So if you were, for instance, to look right here, this is a very interesting sort of hypothesis that a lot of us have, which is that activists tend to drive nomination processes, OK.\\', \"The idea being that pretty much all the candidates look very similar ideologically and so you have to have cues on who you\\'re going to go for.\", \"So Seth Masket, who\\'s a political scientist, essentially interviews Democratic activists in the early states and he said, OK, who would you consider supporting even if you\\'re undecided at this point.\", \"And what we see is Harris at Iowa is number one, Harris in New Hampshire at two, Nevada, three, and South Carolina -- I\\'m sorry, two in Nevada and first in South Carolina.\", \\'That is by far the strongest position among the activists.\\', \"So as she becomes better known and as people tune into the race, what I would expect to happen is that the voters in these states will follow the activists\\' lead and Harris is obviously in a strong position among the activists in these different states.\", \\'BERMAN: All right, how much time do we have left?\\', \"All right, we have time to go to Trump\\'s poll numbers and football?\", \"ENTEN: We have -- I think we have time to go to Trump\\'s poll numbers and football.\", \\'Why not?\\', \\'OK.\\', \"So, of course, if, at the end of the day, we\\'re only interested -- we\\'re interested in who the Democratic nominee is, not for the sake of who the Democratic nominee is because we think they could be the next president.\", \\'And one of the reasons we think they could be the next president is because Donald Trump is polling in such poor shape.\\', \"Pew Research asked over the week -- last week, do you view that President Trump\\'s -- do you think it will ultimately be successful or unsuccessful?\", \"And what\\'s so interesting here is only 29 percent say successful, 47 percent say unsuccessful, and 23 percent say too early to tell.\", \"Why that\\'s so interesting, because this isn\\'t just you prove or disapprove of him now.\", \"This is asking, do you think he\\'s going to actually have a shot to be successful in the future.\", \\'Very -- a very low percentage think that.\\', \\'This is a record number -- record percentage for unsuccessful.\\', \\'Not just at this point in the presidency, but even George W.

OK. On the terra firma note, you\\\\\\'ve obviously seen this back and forth he had with \"the New Yorker\" and there was this one fascinating piece of it where they asked Rudy Giuliani whether he\\\\\\'s worried about saying things for Trump and the facts that he might, quote, not always be truthful about it and he said, quote, I\\\\\\'m afraid it will be on my gravestone and he clarified this when he talked to you.\\', \\'What did he mean by that?\\', \"[14:25:00] BASH: He was joking about that, but what has come from that are questions about whether or not what he meant was that he\\'s lying for the President and that\\'s what I asked Giuliani about when we spoke just a short while ago and this is what he said.\", \"He said, I\\'m not lying for the President.\", \"The reason I said that is everybody\\'s concerned with legacy.\", \"I can\\'t figure out why because you don\\'t get a chance to whatever you do in life, you don\\'t get a chance to shape the way people see it later so you do what you think is right.\", \"He also said to me that, you know, he understood when he took this job that 50 percent -- at least 50 percent of the country would hate him for it and he said that you used to be that you defended people who were in tough situations and you got credit for it and he said he still sees his job that way as a lawyer and, of course, as somebody who\\'s been friends with Donald Trump for decades and decades.\", \\'BALDWIN: OK.

played his best game and I think he knows it.\", \\'But the 57-yard field goal, that was unbelievable, the Rams kicked.\\', \\'That was incredible.\\', \\'But now a rules change, is that where we are going?\\', \\'We are going to review every play?\\', \"WATSON: I think the league is constantly evolving, and over the course of my 15-year career I\\'ve seen rules change.\", \\'Something that happened in the game, and then the next year the Competition Committee comes together and creates a rule to fix that.\\', \"And those things happen because, again, it\\'s an imperfect game.\", \\'And so when it comes to this, obviously I think there will be a huge discussion in February by the Competition Committee about how do we prevent this sort of thing from happening?\\', \\'How can we be sitting here a couple days after championship weekend and not celebrating the two teams that are in there but talking about some missed calls by referees who are the best at what they do?\\', \\'And so it may be something as, I say simple, but as important as being able to review a P.I.\\', \"call, a pass interference call, that happened, and also one that didn\\'t happen, because a lot of times pass interference calls happen that shouldn\\'t be called as well.\", \\'So there needs to be something done.\\', \"Again, that doesn\\'t console us, it does make us feel better, but we understand that life goes on.\", \"And in many times, life isn\\'t fair.\", \"INGRAHAM: No, it isn\\'t.\", \\'Jason Whitlock, I know you know Jason, he was speaking today about the Saints and the reaction.\\', \"Let\\'s watch.\", \\'(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON WHITLOCK: The Saints are not victims, not in my opinion.\\', \\'Victims are targeted.\\', \\'The referee who failed to call the penalty on this pass had no intentions of harming the New Orleans Saints.\\', \\'In fact, his motivation was to protect the integrity of the outcome.\\', \"He failed to act because he didn\\'t want a judgment call by the refs to decide the game.\", \\'(END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Is Jason right?\\', \\'WATSON: He is right to an extent.\\', \"Referees are told that in the end of very important games, you\\'re talking about playoff games with Super Bowl implications, referees don\\'t want to determine the outcome.\", \\'They want to say let the players play.\\', \"But when there is something as obvious as that, you have got three referee standing there, that\\'s a time when a flag needs to come out.\", \\'There needs to be a call made.\\', \"And I don\\'t -- I\\'m not saying that the referee\\'s intent was malicious, but I can say he did not do his job there.\", \\'And when you look at the game, we had -- look, as a player, you want to win the game on your own terms, and we had a chance in overtime.\\', \\'We got the ball first and over time.\\', \"We weren\\'t able to drive down the field.\", \\'There were other opportunities for us to win.\\', \"But again, looking back at the game, there will be some rule changes, but it won\\'t help for where we stand right now.\", \"INGRAHAM: Hey Ben, I\\'ve seen all the pictures of your kids.\", \\'My question is, are they playing football?\\', \\'And which one right now wants to play in a bad, bad way?\\', \"Maybe come back and play the Super Bowl sometime when he\\'s a little older, avenge this loss?\", \\'WATSON: Yes, my seven-year-old.\\', \\'My seven-year-old, Isaiah.\\', \\'It just clicked for him this year.\\', \"The younger ones don\\'t really get it yet, but my seven-year-old, we were just outside throwing the football when he got home from school today.\", \"And so he\\'s the one that took it the hardest.\", \"And he\\'s the one that\\'s always talking about playing football.\", \"But I think we\\'re going to wait a little bit for him.\", \"And if it\\'s up to his mom and me, he\\'d go play baseball or golf or something with guaranteed contracts.\", \\'(LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: OK. Oh, come on.\\', \"I\\'ve seen them playing.\", \"We\\'ve got to get those Watson kids on the field.\", \"Ben, it\\'s great to see you.\", \"You\\'ve had an unbelievable career, and you\\'ve been such an inspiration to young people across this country.\", \"And I\\'ve been following your career for so many years.\", \\'I know you hear this a lot, but what you have done for the community and with your family and just who you are as a man, forget a player, we salute you, and we thank you.\\', \"That\\'s much more important than any Super Bowl.\", \"That\\'s all I can say.\", \\'ARROYO: Who Dat.\\', \\'INGRAHAM: Who Dat.\\', \\'WATSON: I appreciate it.\\', \\'Who Dat.\\', \\'INGRAHAM: You take care.\\', \\'And coming up, from city squares to college campuses, American history being systematically eradicated, is that an exaggeration?\\', \"It\\'s not.\", \"It\\'s happening at Notre Dame next.\", \\'INGRAHAM: Covering up our history?\\', \"That\\'s what the University of Notre Dame is doing right now.\", \\'In a shocking announcement, the school says it will cover these murals, I just saw them bac in September when I was at the game, dating back to the late 1800s that depict Christopher Columbus in America.\\', \"The university president, Father John Jenkins, liberal, says students and faculty have been complaining for years, poor babies, claiming the murals don\\'t show the darker side of the story.\", \\'Joining me now is Catherine Viz, a Notre Dame student and campus reform correspondent, and Democratic analyst Jonathan Harris.\\', \"Catherine, let\\'s start with you.\", \\'Did the school give opposing views and opportunity to make their arguments against the covering up of art?\\', \\'CATHERINE VIZ, NOTRE DAME STUDENT: Hi, Laura.\\', \\'Thank you for having me.\\', \\'It is interesting to see how the Native American perspective was of course embraced.\\', \\'But it was seemingly impossible to seem to have a conservative viewpoint on this issue, especially with the idea of covering up, or in this case, erasing history.\\', \\'As an important part of learning where we need to go in the future we need to knowledge the evil things that may have happened, no matter how unfortunate.\\', \\'INGRAHAM: Well, and pretty much all of history includes a really scary and bad and evil things.\\', \\'And yet we want to see history.\\', \\'Jonathan, the same thing happened at Dartmouth College when I was there, these things called the Hovey Grill murals.\\', \\'And they were Native Americans, and Eleazar Wheelock, who founded Dartmouth, and it was a bit of a caricature depiction of a song about Dartmouth.\\', \\'There is a huge fight over these murals.\\', \\'They ultimately covered them, then they opened them up, and then they moved them off campus.\\', \"So this is going back to the \\'80s.\", \\'so this whole thing about covering murals, moving murals continues.\\', \\'Why is this liberal to cover art?\\', \"JONATHAN HARRIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: It\\'s not covering arts.\", \\'They have even said, the university said, they are going to reproduce them in HD and people will be able to go see them, but they will be in proper context.\\', \\'INGRAHAM: They had little pamphlets.\\', \\'I was there in September.\\', \\'I thought they were actually really beautiful.\\', \\'They are really beautiful.\\', \\'And they had pamphlets explaining the context there.\\', \"But the pamphlets weren\\'t good enough for the antihistory people.\", \\'HARRIS: Is not appropriate.\\', \\'I hope that our mores will change.\\', \\'These were done in the 1800s, the late 1800s.\\', \\'I hope our mores have changed just a little bit since the late 1800s.\\', \"And to move them, cover them up and say that\\'s not where we are anymore is absolutely the right step.\", \\'The art is still going to be available, but these things need to be put away in museums, in places where this is where we were.\\', \\'This is not where we are.\\', \"And as long as it\\'s constantly displayed, it says it\\'s where we are.\", \\'INGRAHAM: Caroline, this is what Sohrab Ahmari in \"The New York Post\" pointed out today.\\', \\'\"Notre Dame will cover problematic Columbus tapestries.\\', \\'This is the kind of thing the Iranian regime does, and we criticize its philistine barbarism.\\', \\'Only in the U.S. academy it\\\\\\'s done in the name of progress and liberality.\"\\', \\'I think about the Taliban and taking -- smashing historical carvings and cliffs which can never be reproduced.\\', \"I\\'m not trying to compare the murals, but you can find offense in everything.\", \"I\\'m sure there are people who look at the dome and see our lady on the dome.\", \"And if you don\\'t believe the Catholic faith, you might be offended by it.\", \\'Right?\\', \\'There she is.\\', \\'I bet you could probably get 300 students somewhere who say that our lady offends them and they need to change the name of the university.\\', \\'Do you see where this goes?\\', \\'Art is almost meant to offend.\\', \\'I thought that was the cool contemporary art thing.\\', \\'Offend people.\\', \\'HARRIS: Absolutely, absolutely.\\', \\'But not to make a monument to people.\\', \\'Columbus referred to as Native American saying that they would make great servants.\\', \\'That was his first observation of them when -- INGRAHAM: George Washington

absolutely, I think more debate is great.\\', \"HARRIS: And when we come to that conclusion, it\\'s OK.

were big losers.', 'United dropped 2.63%, while Southwest fell 2%.', 'Delta fell 2.1% to 47.10, near its year low of 45.08.', 'And American fell 3.62% to 32.74, near a 52-week low of 28.81 While the market decline and the continuing government shutdown may or may not be related, what is clear is that the shutdown is causing painful, if not necessarily permanent, damage.Issues with the TSAare only the tip of the iceberg.', 'For example, Southwest had planned to begin flights from California (San Diego, Oakland, Sacramento, and San Jose) to Hawaii by early 2019.', 'The highly-anticipated service has been pushed back, however, because the aviation inspectors who would certify Southwest 737 MAX aircraft for ETOPs (extended twin-engine operation) service for the long over-water flight have been furloughed due to the government shutdown.', 'Similarly, Delta is hot to get its new Airbus A220 jets into operation.', 'The A220, co-manufactured by Embraer and Airbus, hits a sweet spot for many airlines.', 'It provides a fuel-efficient solution in the 100-passenger space, where a Boeing 737 would harder to fill and more expensive to operate.', 'But Delta can t put its A220s into service (CNBC reported that seven aircraft are affected) until FAA inspectors get back to work.', 'Thefurloughs of inspectorsalso affect aircraft that are in repair stations, which need safety sign-offs to return to their fleets.', 'Separately, Delta issued a warning that the government shutdown will cut business travel, driving the airline srevenue down $25 millionthis quarter.', 'Much of the decline can be attributed to government employees and contractors not traveling.', 'America s de facto national holiday, Super Bowl Sunday, may be under pressure from the shutdown as well.', 'This year Super Bowl LIII between the Los Angele Rams and New England Patriots takes place at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.', 'The city is also home to the world s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson, (ATL), which handled 104 million passengers last year.', 'Up to three hour waits at TSA security checkpoints at ATL have already been reported.', 'While ATL typically handles about 70,000 fliers a day,more than 110,000are anticipated on February 4, the day after the Super Bowl.', 'With an unprecedented 10% of TSA employees calling in sick on January 20, if the shutdown continues there will be fewer screeners to handle more people, presenting a nightmare delay scenario.', 'The TSA situation is only part of the problem for the upcoming Super Bowl.', 'Air controllers around the country (who are also not being paid during the government shut down), will have to cope with up to 1,500 extra flights a day, mostly private jets.', 'The Super Bowl is considered the most popular event for private

shutdown.', 'Obviously, aircraft that can t be inspected can t go to work.', 'Whether passenger safety has been compromised or will be under pressure as the government shutdown continues, is an issue no one seems to want to think about.', 'Last week someone boarding at Atlanta managed to take a gun on board a flight to Narita, Japan.', 'The TSA said the incident, which resulted in the firing of two TSA employees, did not result from the shutdown.', 'However, with sickouts reaching 10% on Sunday, it appears that many TSA personnel are too stressed (or too broke) to get to work, or that they are already working another job.', 'Many are going to food banks, working second jobs, and undergoing significant financial stress.CNBCnotes that American Airlines credit union is offering 1 percent

pretty clear at this point that it\\'s not going to happen and that it was never going to happen.\", \"And, upon inspection of the NFL rule book, it\\'s highly debatable whether Goodell actually has the authority to make it happen.\", \\'The rule book empowers the commissioner to overturn the result of a game for what it calls an \"extraordinarily unfair\" act.\\', \\'However, the same section of the rule book says that \"judgmental errors ... by game officials\" do not qualify.\\', \"That didn\\'t stop Thomas from taking to Twitter to cite Rule 17 Section 2 Article 3, which gives Goodell the authority to reverse a game result or order a game to be replayed.\", \\'And it didn\\\\\\'t stop Thomas from following up by writing on Twitter: \"Hey Roger pick up the phone.\"\\', \\'Thomas, the Saints and their fans remain angry and despondent about how events unfolded at the end of regulation in their 26-23 overtime loss Sunday to the Rams at the Superdome.\\', \\'The game was tied at 20 in the final two minutes when Rams defender Nickell Robey-Coleman bowled over Saints wide receiver Tommylee Lewis before a pass by quarterback Drew Brees arrived.\\', \\'But officials failed to call what amounted to a blatant pass interference penalty.\\', \\'Robey-Coleman also got away with an illegal hit on Lewis for helmet-to-helmet contact with a defenseless receiver.\\', \\'Instead of having a first down that would have enabled them to score a touchdown or run down the clock before kicking a field goal, the Saints kicked an immediate field goal.\\', \\'That gave the Rams time to kick a tying field goal in regulation, and they won on an overtime field goal after Brees threw an interception.\\', \\'The NFL has acknowledged the officiating error.\\', \"Al Riveron, the league\\'s senior vice president of officiating, told Saints Coach Sean Payton, a member of the NFL\\'s rulemaking competition committee, after the game that pass interference should have been called.\", \\'That has led Thomas and others to turn to Rule 17 Section 2 of the rule book, which is titled \"Extraordinarily Unfair Acts.\"\\', \\'In Article 3 of that section, the rule book says: \"The Commissioner\\\\\\'s powers under this Section 2 include the imposition of monetary fines and draft-choice forfeitures, suspension of persons involved in unfair acts, and, if appropriate, the reversal of a game\\\\\\'s result or the rescheduling of a game, either from the beginning or from the point at which the extraordinary act occurred.\"\\', \\'But the rule book also says right above that in Article 2: \"The Commissioner will not apply authority in cases of complaints by clubs concerning judgmental errors or routine errors of omission by game officials.\\', \\'Games involving such complaints will continue to stand as complete.\"\\', \\'So Thomas and the Saints, it appears, always were out of luck.\\', \"As ridiculously terrible as Sunday\\'s non-call was, bad calls are part of the normal course of events in a game.\", \\'This rule seems designed for something other than that, such as, say, a fan taking the field to interfere with a play.\\', \\'\"The Commissioner has the sole authority to investigate and take appropriate disciplinary and/or corrective measures if any club action, non-participant interference, or calamity occurs in an NFL game which the Commissioner deems so extraordinarily unfair or outside the accepted tactics encountered in professional football that such action has a major effect on the result of the game,\" the rule book says in Article 1 of that section.\\', \\'NFL leaders and competition committee members plan to give serious consideration this offseason to making pass interference reviewable by instant replay.\\', \"Sunday\\'s play was not reviewable, and the competition committee long has opposed making pass interference and other judgment calls by the on-field officials subject to replay.\", \"But Sunday\\'s miscarriage of on-field justice perhaps could change some minds.\", \\'Any such rule change would have to be approved by at least 24 of the 32 teams and would take effect next season.\\', \\'Too late to help the Saints.\\', \\'\"I have been in touch with the NFL regarding yesterday\\\\\\'s events and will aggressively pursue changes in NFL policies to ensure no team and fan base is ever put in a similar position again,\" Saints owner Gayle Benson said in the written statement she released Monday.\\', \\'\"It is a disservice to our coaches, players, employees and, most importantly, the fans who make our game possible.\\', \\'The NFL must always commit to providing the most basic of expectations - fairness and integrity.\"\\', \\'But the Saints and their fans will simply have to live with this.\\', \"The Rams are headed to the Super Bowl, and that\\'s not going to change.\"]': 20.11971524044747,\n",

Saints coach Sean Payton that game officials missed not one but two calls when Rams cornerback Nikell Robey-Coleman slammed into Saints wide receiver Tommylee Lewis on a pass from Drew Brees.\\', \\'The no calls likely cost New Orleans a chance to run the clock down to 15 seconds or so and kick a short field goal that if good would have left Los Angeles relying on a kickoff return or Hail Mary to pull out the win or the tie.\\', \\'As it was, the Saints had to kick a field goal with 1:41 left, leaving plenty of time for the Rams to send the game to overtime 23-23.\\', \\'After Brees was hit and intercepted, the Rams kicked a field goal to win 26-23 and go to the Super Bowl.\\', \\'The no call on Robey-Coleman is already being called one of the worst officiating blunders in sports history.\\', \\'It is a measure of infamous respect in a sense, though not one likely to give Saints fans much comfort in the days and years to come.\\', \"The list of the worst calls ever is purely subjective, but if we can agree Sunday\\'s play was one of the worst, here are 10 others in chronological order to hang in the galling gallery alongside it: Three seconds in Munich The U.S. team was 63-0 in the Olympics and thought it had secured another win and a gold medal as time ran out on a 50-49 victory over the Soviet Union in the 1972 Munich Games.\", \\'But officials twice put :03 back on the clock because Soviet coaches claimed they called time out before U.S. player Doug Collins second of two free throws to give the Americans the lead.\\', \"The USSR\\'s Sergei Belov finally made a layup off a full-court pass at the buzzer for a 51-50 victory.\", \\'U.S. officials protested to no avail.\\', \\'To this day none of the 12 American players have ever accepted their silver medals.\\', \"Denkinger\\'s blunder In the ninth inning of Game 6 of the 1985 World Series, umpire Don Denkinger called the Kansas City Royal\\'s Jorge Orta safe at first base against the St. Louis Cardinals.\", \\'Replays showed Cardinals pitcher Todd Worrell clearly beat Orta to the bag.\\', \\'The Royals rallied for two runs in the ninth to win 2-1 and went on to pound the Cardinals 11-0 in Game 7.\\', \"\\'The hand of God\\' In the 1986 World Cup quarterfinals against England in Mexico City, Argentine star Diego Maradona worked between two defenders (perhaps offside) to score a goal that helped lift his team to a 2-1 victory.\", \\'Maradona later admitted he punched the ball in with his hand, saying the goal was scored \"partly by the hand of God and partly by the head of Maradona.\"\\', \\'Argentina went on to beat West Germany for the title.\\', \\'The robbing of Roy Jones Jr.\\', \"In the 1988 Olympic light middleweight boxing medal final in Seoul, South Korea, American Roy Jones Jr. pummeled South Korean Park Si-Hun for three rounds, landing 86 punches to Park\\'s 32 and forcing two standing eight counts.\", \\'Yet inexplicably, Park was ruled the winner 3-2.\\', \\'Later there were allegations of bribery against the three judges who voted for Park, though a 1997 IOC investigation refused to confirm those findings.\\', \\'The fifth down Trailing 31-27 in a 1990 game at Missouri, the Colorado Buffaloes late-game drive got the benefit of an extra \"fifth\" down when game officials failed to change the down marker after a spike by quarterback Charles Johnson.\\', \\'With future LSU coach Gerry DiNardo calling plays as offensive coordinator, Johnson scored on a 1-yard keeper as time expired in a 33-31 victory.\\', \\'The controversial win kept the Buffaloes on track for a share of the national championship with Georgia Tech.\\', \"Jeter and Jeffrey Twelve-year old New York Yankees fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the fence in Yankee Stadium in Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS to catch a fly ball by New York\\'s Derek Jeter, denying Baltimore Orioles right fielder Tony Tarasco a chance to make the play.\", \\'Umpire Rich Garcia called it a home run and the Yankees went on to a 4-1 series victory and the 1996 World Series title.\\', \\'Heads or tails?\\', \\'The 1998 Thanksgiving Day game between the visiting Pittsburgh Steelers and Detroit Lions went to overtime tied 16-16.\\', \\'On the overtime coin toss, Steelers running back Jerome Bettis called \"tails,\" but referee Phil Luckett insisted he said \"heads,\" giving the Lions the chance to receive the ball first.\\', \\'Detroit went on to win 19-16 on a field goal under the sudden death overtime rules at the time.\\', \"In the crease In Game 6 of the 1999 Stanley Cup finals, the Dallas Stars\\' Brett Hull beat Buffalo Sabres goalkeeper Dominik Hasek for the series winning goal in triple overtime, 2-1.\", \"Video evidence showed Hull\\'s skate was in the crease (the blue colored ice in front of the goal) before the puck, a hockey no-no at the time.\", \\'But officials missed the call and did not ask for a replay.\\', \\'The imperfect game On June 2, 2010, Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga was one out away from what at the time would have been just the 21st perfect game in major league history.\\', \\'Galarraga got Jason Donald to ground to first baseman Miguel Cabrera, who tossed the ball to the pitcher for what appeared to be the final out by a half step.\\', \\'Instead, umpire Jim Joyce ruled Donald safe.\\', \\'Galarraga got the next batter out, but the damage was done.\\', \\'A tearful Joyce admitted his mistake afterward.\\', \"\\'Is this a joke?\\'\", \"In the 2017 ANA Inspiration tournament, the first women\\'s golf major of the season, Lexi

       " \"['Russell Baker, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author whose whimsical, irreverent “Observer” column appeared in The New York Times and hundreds of other newspapers for 36 years and turned a backwoods-born Virginian into one of America’s most celebrated writers, died on Monday at his home in Leesburg, Va.', 'He was 93.', 'The cause was complications from a fall, according to his son Allen Baker.', 'Mr. Baker, along with the syndicated columnist Art Buchwald (who died in 2007), was one of the best-known newspaper humorists of his time, and The Washington Post ranked his best-selling autobiography, “Growing Up,” with the most enduring recollections of American boyhood — those of James Thurber, H. L. Mencken and Mark Twain.', 'In a career begun in a rakish fedora and the smoky press rooms of the 1940s, Mr. Baker was a police reporter, a rewrite man and a London correspondent for The Baltimore Sun, and after 1954 a Washington correspondent for The Times, rising swiftly with a clattering typewriter and a deft writer’s touch to cover the White House, Congress and the presidential campaigns of 1956 and 1960.', 'Then, starting in 1962, he became a columnist for The Times and its news service, eventually composing nearly 5,000 “Observer” commentaries — 3.7 million insightful words on the news of the day — often laced with invented characters and dialogue, on an array of subjects including dreaded Christmas fruitcake and women’s shoulder pads.', 'The columns, which generated a devoted following, critical acclaim and the 1979 Pulitzer for distinguished commentary, ended with his retirement in 1998.', 'To a generation of television watchers, he was also a familiar face as the host of “Masterpiece Theater” on PBS from 1993 to 2004, having succeeded Alistair Cooke.', 'Mr. Baker wrote 15 books, including many collections of his columns, and “Growing Up,” a 1982 memoir of his Depression-era youth, his inspirational mother and America between the wars.', 'It earned him his second Pulitzer, the 1983 prize for biography.', 'Besides his two Pulitzer Prizes, he won two George Polk Awards, for commentary in 1978 and career achievement in 1998, and many other honors.', 'After his retirement from The Times, Mr. Baker wrote for The New York Review of Books on politics, history, journalism and other subjects.', 'A collection of 11 of those essays, on revered public figures, was published in 2002 under the title “Looking Back.” Earlier, he wrote for Life, Look, Reader’s Digest, The Saturday Evening Post, Ladies’ Home Journal and other publications.', 'From 1985 through 1994, he served on the Columbia University Pulitzer Prize board, selecting winners of the nation’s most prestigious awards in journalism, literature and the arts.', 'He was its chairman in 1993 and 1994.', '‘Ballet in a Telephone Booth’ But it was as a columnist that Mr. Baker made his name.', 'Based at first in Washington, he recalled that he had to feel his way in the new genre of spoof and jape.', '“Nobody knew what the column was going to be,” he told the writer Nora Ephron.', '“I didn’t.', 'The Times didn’t.” But soon he was doing what he called his “ballet in a telephone booth,” creating in the confined space of 750 words satirical dialogues, parodies and burlesques of politicians and the whirling capital circus — then stoking the fires of the antiwar and civil rights struggles of the 1960s and the Watergate scandal that forced President Richard M. Nixon from office in 1974.', 'That year, Mr. Baker moved from Washington to New York, and his column changed.', 'His topics grew more varied, less tied to news events and more to the trappings of ordinary life.', 'His writing, admirers said, matured into literature: an owlish wit, sometimes surreal, often absurdist, usually scouring dark corridors of paradox, always carried off with a subtext of good sense.', 'He wrote of Francisco Franco’s dying and going straight to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles.', 'In another column, a pseudonymous Sykes tells of awakening one day to find that he has someone else’s feet.', 'Sykes conceals the shame from his wife and colleagues.', 'Doctors are no help.', 'Finally he confides to an editor, who signs him to a three-book contract.', 'The feet become television celebrities.', 'Hollywood wants Sykes’s life story for a Robert Redford movie.', 'In 1975, after The Times’s food editor and restaurant critic Craig Claiborne reported in gastronomic detail on a $4,000 31-course epicurean repast for two, with wines, in Paris, Mr. Baker wrote “Francs and Beans,” describing his own culinary triumph after coming home to find a note in the kitchen saying his wife had gone out.', '“The meal opened with a 1975 Diet Pepsi served in a disposable bottle,” he wrote.', '“Although its bouquet was negligible, its distinct metallic aftertaste evoked memories of tin cans one had licked experimentally in the first flush of childhood’s curiosity.” And on to a “pâté de fruites de nuts of Georgia”: “A half-inch layer of creamy-style peanut butter is troweled onto a graham cracker, then half a banana is crudely diced and pressed firmly into the peanut butter and cemented in place as it were by a second graham cracker.” Two years later, he conceived “A Taxpayer’s Prayer”: “O mighty Internal Revenue, who turneth the labor of man to ashes, we thank thee for the multitude of thy forms which thou has set before us and for the infinite confusion of thy commandments which multiplieth the fortunes of lawyer and accountant alike.', '…” His targets were legion: the Super Bowl, Miss America, unreadable menus, everything on television, trips with children, the jogging craze, the perils of buying a suit, loneliness and book-of-the-month clubs.', 'He struck poses of despair that resonated with harried readers: of his endless effort to read Proust, of lacking the gene for resisting salesmen, of boredom with dull dirty books.', 'Stylistically, the “Observer” examined the American scene with plain phrases that echoed Twain as they skewered the pompous.', 'But his voice could be haunting, as in a 1974 column on older poor people in a supermarket: “Staring at 90-cent peanut butter.', 'Taking down an orange, looking for the price, putting it back.” “Old people at the supermarket are being crushed and nobody is even screaming,” he wrote.', 'Mr. Baker occasionally hammered at uncaring government or big business, but frontal attacks were not his stock in trade.', '“What Baker does,” Ronald Steel wrote in Geo magazine in 1983, “is punch holes in vast bubbles of pretension, humanize the abstract and connect the present with what one predecessor, Walter Lippmann, once described as the ‘longer past and the larger future.’” A subversive among the sober editorial voices of The Times, Mr. Baker could be tongue-in-cheek one day and melancholy the next, then folksy, anguished, lyrical or acid.', 'He once wrote a Jonathan Swift-like satire on the advantages of public hanging, arguing that a society pleased with capital punishment might do well to cut off thieves’ hands and notch the noses of incurable double parkers.', 'His column ran on three weekdays a week from 1962 to 1972, then switched to a schedule he likened to the “metronomic” rhythms of “Chinese water torture: FridaySundayTuesday, FridaySundayTuesday.” After 1988, the column ran on Tuesdays and Saturdays.', 'He cut back to one a week in July 1997 and retired “Observer” on Dec. 25, 1998.', 'His last column, “A Few Words at the End,” on Christmas, “a day on which nobody reads a newspaper anyhow,” spoke of his love affair with newspapers.', '“Thanks to newspapers,” he wrote, “I have made a four-hour visit to Afghanistan, have seen the Taj Mahal by moonlight, breakfasted at dawn on lamb and couscous while sitting by the marble pool of a Moorish palace in Morocco and once picked up a persistent family of fleas in the Balkans.” [Video: Watch on YouTube.]', 'Lanky and laconic, Mr. Baker was reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart’s reporter in the 1948 movie “Call Northside 777.” He had a rumpled, tired look, as if he had pored over old court records all night under a dim bulb and come to the prison, still skeptical, to see the wrongly convicted man.', 'Ms. Ephron saw him as “extremely low-key, terribly nice, often on the verge of being embarrassed, particularly by praise of any sort.” He had kindly blue eyes with droopy lids and an unruly thatch of sandy-gray hair that fell over his forehead like a country boy’s.', 'He liked to flop in a chair, put his foot up on a radiator and talk about practically anything.', 'His voice was gravelly but soft, a faded echo of rural Virginia: perfect for the barbed lash or the awful oxymoron.', 'And he was as devilish in person as in print.', 'A fellow Times columnist, Tom Wicker, recalled that Mr. Baker, talking once to college students, was asked, “What courses should a journalism school teach?” He replied: “The ideal journalism school needs only one course.', 'Students should be required to stand outside a closed door for six hours.', 'Then the door would open, someone would put his head around the jamb and say, ‘No comment.’ The door would close again, and the students would be required to write 800 words against a deadline.” The Making of a Newsman Russell Wayne Baker was born into poverty on Aug. 14, 1925, in Loudoun County, Va., and spent his early years in Morrisonville.', '“It was primitive,” he recalled.', '“No electricity.” When Russell was 5, his father, Benjamin Rex Baker, a stonemason who was often out of work, drank moonshine one night, sank into a diabetic coma and died, leaving his wife and three children destitute.', 'Russell’s strong-willed mother, Lucy Elizabeth Robinson Baker, was forced to give up an infant daughter to childless in-laws and took the boy and his younger sister to live with her brother in Newark.', 'The uncle, a $35-a-week butter salesman, was the family’s only wage earner in the Depression, though Mrs. Baker eventually found work as a seamstress and Russell sold magazines door to door.', 'When Russell was 11, the family moved to Baltimore, where he attended high school.', 'He was popular, a member of the track team and a promising writer, winning a senior essay contest with “The Art of Eating Spaghetti.” He entered Johns Hopkins University on a scholarship in 1942, but left the next year to join the Navy.', 'He took pilot training, but never went abroad during World War II and left the service in 1945.', 'Returning to Johns Hopkins on the G.I.', 'Bill, Mr. Baker graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English in 1947.', 'He wanted to be Ernest Hemingway, but had no real idea what to do.', 'Then a friend who worked part time for The Baltimore Sun told him about a job.', 'It was not much, but he took it: $30 a week as a night police reporter.', 'For two years, he phoned in robberies, fires and mayhem, and slept late.', 'He helped organize the Newspaper Guild at The Sun and became a tenacious unionist.', 'In the summer of 1948, he churned out a novel about a reporter in love.', 'He had just broken up with Miriam Emily Nash, a native of Camden, N.J., whom he had met after the war.', 'The novel wound up in the attic, but he married Mimi, as she was called, in 1950.', 'She died in 2015 at 88.', 'Mr. Baker is survived by three children, Allen, Michael and Kasia, as well as four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.', 'He is also survived by two sisters, Doris Groh and Mary Leslie Keech.', 'By 1950, Mr. Baker had become a rewrite man, taking phoned notes from legmen (reporters at the scene) and banging out stories on deadline.', 'He found he was hooked on journalism, and his skills — speed, accuracy and style — earned him a plum in 1952 when The Sun sent him to London as a correspondent.', 'He later became The Sun’s White House correspondent, and his work in the capital caught the eye of James Reston, the Washington bureau chief of The Times, who hired him in 1954.', 'His first Times assignment was the State Department.', 'He found it boring.', 'Congress, with its preening V.I.P.s, was better grist.', 'Readers devoured Baker articles peppered with wry observations that captured the feel of Washington.', 'He was soon drawing top assignments: presidential campaigns in 1956 and 1960, trips by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, and others that showcased his lucidity.', 'Taking a New Direction But he was still restless.', 'Trying to keep out of a rut, he wrote “An American in Washington” (1961), a guide to the capital, detailing the techniques of name-dropping, the importance of lunch and advice on how to talk endlessly without saying anything.', 'Critics and readers were delighted, but ennui sat naggingly on his shoulder.', 'One day he found himself on a bench outside a closed meeting of a Senate committee, wondering why, at 37, he was “waiting for somebody to come out and lie to me.” He was near the end.', 'In 1962, The Sun tried to lure him back with a column, but The Times made a counteroffer, and he accepted.', 'The column idea was vague.', 'He had in mind casual essays like E. B. White’s in The New Yorker, cast in “plain English” with “short sentences,” in contrast to what he called The Times’s “polysyllabic Latinate English.” Soon the columns began to roll out of his typewriter: on the foibles of politicians, bureaucrats, military contractors.', 'Spoofing a plan to haul nuclear weapons around the country on railroad cars, he proposed a system of mobile Pentagons, complete with little secretaries of defense and presidents who would crisscross the country to confuse the enemy.', 'During the Pentagon Papers case — a test of government secrecy versus the public’s right to know the truth about the Vietnam War — Mr. Baker wondered in print how long officials intended to suppress the “Miles Standish papers,” saying their disclosure might jeopardize national security.', 'Many Baker columns were collected in books, including “No Cause for Panic” (1964), “Baker’s Dozen” (1964), “All Things Considered” (1965) and “Poor Russell’s Almanac” (1972).', 'He wrote a novel, “Our Next President: The Incredible Story of What Happened in the 1968 Elections” (1968), about an election being thrown into the House of Representatives and chaos enveloping America.', 'Some reviewers called it all too real.', 'After moving to New York in 1974, Mr. Baker took up topics as varied as death and dishwashing, neuroses and the new math.', 'He was often hard-pressed for ideas, but something always seemed to turn up, or down.', 'One day, as the deadline approached, a potato fell past his window.', 'The column the next day was headlined “Potato Mashes Man.” His 1979 Pulitzer — the first to a humorist for commentary — was given for 10 columns on tax reform, inflation, the short life of trends, loneliness, fear, Norman Rockwell and other subjects.', 'More collections were published: “So This Is Depravity” (1980) and “The Rescue of Miss Yaskell and Other Pipe Dreams” (1983).', 'After the success of “Growing Up,” Mr. Baker produced a sequel, “The Good Times,” in 1989, about his days as a young reporter.', 'Though a best seller only briefly, it was hailed by critics.', 'Writing in The Times, Frank Conroy, whose memoir “Stop-Time” had also found wide acclaim, called “The Good Times” splendid, but complained, “It would certainly make life easier for book reviewers if Russell Baker could manage to write something bad once in a while.” As the host of “Masterpiece Theater,” Mr. Baker once did a riff on snooty British clubs, and recalled that Art Buchwald had invited him to join a club he was starting, the American Academy of Humor Columnists.', '“What’s the purpose?” Mr. Baker asked.', '“To keep other people out,” his colleague replied.', '[Video: Watch on YouTube.]', 'Liam Stack contributed reporting.', 'PHOTO: Russell Baker in 1971.', 'He spent decades at The New York Times, and his writings twice earned him the Pulitzer Prize.', '(PHOTOGRAPH BY Israel Shenker FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)']\": 35.997384861252385,\n",

Leach\\'s offense and how it prepared him for the NFL draft process.\", \\'\"[Full-field reads] is something that we did a good bit was read the full field and we had a lot of five-man progressions, which a lot of teams, even pro-style teams in college, are only reading half the field.\\', \\'So, there\\\\\\'s a lot of ways that our offense prepares players for the league and that\\\\\\'s why you see so many young quarterbacks right now having so much success from that system.\"\\', \\'It was when Minshew looked me in the eyes and used air quotes when saying \"pro-style\" that will likely stick with me from that encounter.\\', \\'But if you thought Minshew was the only quarterback down in Mobile with confidence, you would be mistaken.\\', \"West Virginia\\'s Will Grier capped off his first practice session by meeting with the media and declaring himself the best quarterback in the 2019 draft class.\", \\'\"I don\\\\\\'t understand some of the things that have been put out there,\" Grier said.\\', \\'\"I mean, I\\\\\\'m the best quarterback in this class.\\', \\'I think my arm talent is there and my play will speak for itself.\"\\', \\'When asked a question about his arm strength, or perhaps a lack thereof, Grier was pointed in his response: \"I\\\\\\'m confident in my abilities ... ask my receivers, ask the guys at Florida, ask the guys I\\\\\\'ve played against if my arm strength was a problem.\\', \"It doesn\\'t necessarily make me mad, I think my play speaks for itself.\", \\'That\\\\\\'s part of why I\\\\\\'m here: I hope people can see my arm strength out here.\"\\', \\'That question prompted a quick follow up about whether he would be throwing at the combine.\\', \\'\"Absolutely.\"\\', \\'South Practice Recap Before diving into how these quarterbacks fared at Ladd-Peebles Stadium today, it is important to set some expectations.\\', \"Tuesday\\'s practice is all about setting a baseline of performance.\", \\'These quarterbacks are now executing a new offense with unfamiliar receivers, running backs and tight ends, so there is a feeling-out period.\\', \\'For example, if a quarterback misses on a vertical route, either by leading the receiver too far or underthrowing him a bit, that is not necessarily something to downgrade a player for, because there is this adjustment period.\\', \\'How these QBs fare going forward is what you measure.\\', \\'Then there is the fact that it was a bit cold, rainy and raw down in Mobile.\\', \"Now let\\'s take these quarterbacks in alphabetical order and break down their Tuesday.\", \"Will Grier, West Virgina Grier\\'s confidence in the post-practice scrum might have glossed over some of the missed throws he had, but there were still positives to take away from his opening workout.\", \\'At the outset you could see the ball pop out of his hands well when making his throws, which points to the arm strength issue perhaps being graded in his favor.\\', \"During the one-on-one session, he overthrew wide receiver Tyre Brady from Marshall on a post route but came back and had two impressive throws - first on a comeback route to Anthony Johnson from the University of Buffalo working off play-action, and later a curl to Clemson\\'s Hunter Renfrow.\", \\'Both throws were made with very good timing and rhythm, which is an area of his game that could use some refinement.\\', \\'His best throw during the seven-on-seven portion of practice came on a speed out when he correctly identified the off coverage and got the ball out quickly.\\', \\'What might lead some to believe that Grier had a poor day was the two throws at the end of practice in the team session that he missed: First on a crossing route on a play-action boot concept, and second on another play-action concept, this time a double-post route, that he missed high.\\', \\'Tyree Jackson, Buffalo The first thing that stands out about Jackson is his size.\\', \\'He measured in at 6\\\\\\'7,\" and you can tell that he is a, well, large human being.\\', \\'This, however, poses some difficulties for a quarterback, as his size and length leads to mechanical issues, particularly in his lower body.\\', \\'There are times when taller quarterbacks tend to overstride with their lead step, which causes their lead leg to stiffen and straighten, resulting in inconsistent ball placement as the upper and lower parts of the body fall out of sync.\\', \\'Even with these mechanical issues, he can still make some splash throws, such as the deep vertical route he threw to Gary Jennings from West Virginia during the installation period.\\', \\'Another issue to watch with Jackson this week is his processing and play speed.\\', \"Jackson\\'s arm talent is a bit of a double-edged sword right now.\", \\'He makes throws to all levels of the field with impressive velocity, but because of this ability he sometimes waits a bit too long to pull the trigger.\\', \\'On a post route to tight end Dax Raymond from Utah State during the one-on-ones, he drilled in a perfect throw but it came late, and the defender was able to close down the separation.\\', \\'NFL defenders might close fully and break up this throw, so Jackson will need to get faster.\\', \\'But despite his flaws and hesitancy, he has tremendous raw talent.\\', \"The question facing his future is whether he\\'ll have the chance to develop these traits in the NFL, a league that has a quarterback graveyard filled with talented players that were never given the chance to develop.\", \"Gardner Minshew, Washington State Minshew\\'s focus on full-field progression reads is one of those traits that shows up both on film and even on the practice field, as it did today at Ladd-Peebles.\", \\'On his game tape you can see him work through these full-field, four- and five-receiver concepts, but what stands out most is his feet.\\', \\'As he works from sideline to sideline scanning a play, his feet are in perfect synchronization with his mind and his eyes, keeping him in the ready position to make a throw once he finds an open target.\\', \\'This was on display early and often during his practice, from the installation period through the team portion of practice.\\', \\'During the one-on-one portion of practice, two throws stood out - first a deep ball to Deebo Samuel from South Carolina that he dropped in the bucket, and later a Bang 8 Post route that he threw to Brady with good velocity and placement.\\', \\'If you wanted a live example of his footwork today, you could point to a rep he had during the seven-on-seven portion when he ran a Sticks concept, with four curl routes and a checkdown to choose from.\\', \\'As Minshew worked through all four curl routes and then finally to the checkdown, you saw his feet working in concert with his mind, scanning his options while remaining ready to strike.\\', \\'Jarrett Stidham, Auburn If there was a way to place a bet on what quarterback might rise the most this week, you could place money on Stidham and be in a good position to collect.\\', \"Now, part of this might come from a starting point, as Stidham\\'s final season at Auburn did not exactly live up to expectations.\", \\'But down in Mobile, with the chance to throw to some new receivers in a different offense, Stidham has the opportunity to distance himself from the tape he put on display this season.\\', \\'That potential was on display today, as he made a number of impressive throws on corner routes, whether during the one-on-one or the seven-on-seven portions of practice.\\', \\'He ripped a pretty good out route to running back Bruce Johnson from North Dakota State during the one-on-one portion of practice, as well as a perfect corner route to Foster Moreau, a tight end from LSU.\\', \\'However, later in practice he was a bit slow with some decisions, both in the seven-on-seven portions as well as the team part of practice.\\', \\'He also missed a chance to hit an open dig route during the team portion.\\', \\'Despite these misfires, Stidham still put himself in a good position to start the week.\\', \\'North Practice Recap Ryan Finley, North Carolina State For Finley, \"consistency\" is the focus of the week.\\', \\'During the post-practice scrum, he stressed that \"being consistent during all three days\" was his main goal for the week.\\', \\'Studying his film there was one route concept that I had noticed that he seemed to excel at throwing, a three-receiver concept to a trips formation with the outside receiver running a post, the middle receiver running an out-and-up, and the inside receiver running an out route.\\', \\'When I asked him about it you could see and hear Finley perk up: \"Yep, yep, run that a lot.\\', \"That\\'s a great play.\", \\'That\\\\\\'s just kinda getting one of our best players on a \"Mike\" linebacker or on a safety coming down so that\\\\\\'s a matchup that we love every time.\"\\', \\'More from this section +2 Gov.\\', \"John Bel Edwards pens letter to NFL\\'s Roger Goodell: New Orleans \\'will not forget it\\' Packers once again will stay stateside for entire 2019 season +3 Former Georgia RBs Todd Gurley and Sony Michel set for showdown in Super Bowl LIII While that concept seems to mesh with the idea of Finley being more of a timing and rhythm passer, I was surprised at the velocity he was able to dial up on some short and intermediate routes.\", \"One of the things that Senior Bowl week does each year is send you back to the film to take a second or third look at particular traits in a player, and right now Finley\\'s velocity might be something I revisit in the upcoming weeks.\", \\'There were some nice rhythm throws, such as a play-action over route he threw early in practice, but you also saw him dial up the velocity as practice went on, on some deeper out routes as well as some routes in the quick game.\\', \"I was impressed with Finley\\'s day.\", \\'Drew Lock, Missouri Lock came into this week perhaps wearing the mantle of \"QB1\" down in Mobile, and there were moments today when it seemed as if that mantle was warranted.\\', \\'He had some impressive throws early during the installation periods, such as a corner route, as well as a deep over route off of play-action that he drove into the receiver with good velocity and placement.\\', \"During the one-on-one portion of practice, he dropped in a picturesque throw on a vertical route to Ohio State\\'s Terry McLaurin, and that fits well with his expectations, as he seems to be a quarterback best suited for a vertical passing attack.\", \\'But I was also impressed with him mechanically, at least in terms of his upper body.\\', \"On film, you can see his release point vary from time-to-time, but Tuesday, Lock\\'s release point seemed more consistent, and quicker to boot.\", \\'Speaking of quickness, an issue that popped up on his film was his hesitation at times in the pocket.\\', \"It did not seem to pop up during practice, but it is something I\\'ll be watching for as the week rolls on.\", \\'His best throw of the day might have been one of his final ones, a play-action crossing route that he delivered from an awkward platform, but with very good velocity and placement.\\', \\'Daniel Jones, Duke After Lock, Jones might be the quarterback here that people are most excited to see, given some of the first-round buzz that he has received in recent weeks.\\', \\'Entering this week, I was curious to see how Jones fared down the field.\\', \"Watching Jones on film, I spy a quarterback that\\'s best, if not exclusively, suited to a West Coast passing offense.\", \\'His decision-making and ball placement are at their best when he is running quick game concepts.\\', \\'When looking to go downfield today, however, the results were mixed.\\', \\'Early in practice, he threw a wheel route to a running back that hung up a bit, as well as a vertical route during one-on-ones that seemed to drop off short of the intended target.\\', \\'But as practice wore on, he started to improve in the downfield game.\\', \\'He delivered a strike on a deep out route to McLaurin (that the receiver hauled in with one arm in an impressive effort of his own) and also dropped in a corner route with impressive touch during the seven-on-seven portion of practice.\\', \"(If it seems like I might be harping on the corner routes, it is with good reason, as these throws often require a quarterback to appropriately balance velocity, placement and touch, and as such are a good test of a QB\\'s skill).\", \\'Jones also delivered on a deep out on a Sail concept during seven-on-seven, as well as a deep crosser on a Yankee concept play during the team portion.\\', \\'Trace McSorley, Penn State The Penn State product flashed some of the reasons why he earned a spot on this roster early in practice.\\', \\'During the installation periods, McSorley flashed sufficient velocity on a few throws, including a Bang 8 post route that he delivered with both velocity and precision placement.\\', \\'He also flashed some touch as well, on a deep over route during the installation period.\\', \"When practice turned to the one-on-one portion, he was at his best throwing quick game routes, including great timing and velocity on a slant route, where his footwork was tied perfectly to the receiver\\'s route and break, as well as a deeper comeback route that was delivered with a bit of anticipation to it.\", \\'Often during these practices you can hear a groan come up from the crowd (and I confess to being guilty of groaning from time to time) when a quarterback checks the football down.\\', \\'During seven-on-seven, McSorley was forced to check the football down, but it was the right read, and he made the decision quickly and the throw to running back Karan Higdon from Michigan, turning into a very successful play.\\', \"Tuesday\\'s Winners Remembering that this is just a baseline day, the quarterbacks I came away most impressed with were Minshew, Jackson, Lock and Finley.\", \"Minshew\\'s footwork on Tuesday matched what I saw on film, and his ability to work full-field is clearly something he will continue at the NFL.\", \"Jackson\\'s arm talent and prowess in the vertical passing game is something that will continue to draw attention, and with good reason.\", \\'Lock came into this week needing a solid performance, and he seemed to step up his game a bit with the eyes on him.\\', \"Finally, I\\'ll admit to being impressed by Finley\\'s performance, and anytime a player makes you want to revisit his film, it is worth mentioning.\", \\'The Buzz at Ladd-Peebles One of the best parts about Senior Bowl week is catching up with writers and evaluators from around the country, or even from around the world, such as the case with Matty Brown of Field Gulls, who came over from England, or Seth Galina, who covers LSU for SB Nation but made the trip down from Canada.\\', \\'Being a quarterback guy, most of my conversations focused on the quarterbacks that people were most excited to see in Mobile.\\', \"There were a fair amount of responses for Grier, Minshew and Lock, as well as a number of people excited to see Jackson\\'s potential in person, as well as what Jones can deliver.\", \"Jackson\\'s raw ability seems to be catching more and more attention, and while people do wonder if he\\'ll get the opportunity to develop into a well-rounded quarterback, many believe that if given the chance, he could.\", \\'Many discussions in the stands center on a quarterback who is not here: Kyler Murray.\\', \"There seems to be a growing consensus at least among those in the media world that while Murray\\'s talent might make him worthy of a first round pick in a vacuum, the number of extenuating circumstances around him might see him slide a bit.\", \\'From his size to the potential baseball career, is this the type of situation that would give a general manager the confidence to pull the trigger on him in the first round?\\', \\'Outside of the quarterback position, some receivers that are generating buzz down in Mobile include Samuel and McLaurin, who were already mentioned, as well as Andy Isabella, from the University of Massachusetts.\\', \\'Isabella measured in at just under 5\\\\\\'9\" and 186 pounds, so there might be some concerns about his ability to work on the boundary, but he showed some shiftiness and quickness in person that he displayed on tape.\\', \\'Definitely a player to watch, and yes, the New England Patriots are a team often linked with him in conversation, given their affinity for shifty slot receiver types.\\', \\'Visit ProFootballWeekly.com | View Latest E-Edition This article

anyway.\\', \\'Still, the ruling by the referees was hard to put aside.\\', \"Chiefs fans were also aggrieved by a roughing-the-passer call on a second-and-7 in the fourth quarter after defensive

       " '[\\'Jan 23, 2019( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex) The matchup is now set: the Los Angeles Rams will be playing the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII, and no doubt your employees are very much aware of the upcoming game.\\', \\'A good many of them will be among the estimated 110 million television viewers who will be watching, whether they are passionate fans, more interested in the halftime show, or just there for the commercials.\\', \\'The impact of the Super Bowl will go well beyond that Sunday evening, however.\\', \\'This game will impact your workplace in the days leading up to the event, and even into the following week.\\', \"Here\\'s what every employer needs to know about the Super Bowl.\", \\'Before The Game: Gambling In The Workplace The biggest question most employers have about big-time sporting events like the Super Bowl or March Madness is whether workplace gambling is legal.\\', \"Many offices will start a small betting pool where participants are encouraged to \\'buy a square\\' or otherwise place wagers on various aspects of the game, and sometimes this form of gambling is encouraged or even organized by management.\", \\'Is that legal?\\', \\'Several federal laws prohibit wagers on sporting events, and the actions become much more risky if workers place bets across state lines.\\', \\'But the odds of federal enforcement action against low-end office pools are pretty minimal.\\', \\'State laws vary around the country, although many permit social gambling on events like the Super Bowl as long as the organizer is not skimming money off the top of the pool, the pool is limited to people you know, and the dollar levels remain relatively low.\\', \\'That being said, employers should have bigger concerns than whether the authorities are going to conduct a raid on their premises when it comes to gambling in the workplace.\\', \\'Instead, you should be more concerned about problems that can befall an office when large amounts of cash are floating through the building.\\', \"Also, some workers might feel pressured to join despite religious objections they have to gambling, or just because they don\\'t feel like they can afford to join in.\", \"Finally, some of your workers might be \\'sore losers\\' and not react well to losing money to a coworker, leading to toxic discord in the workplace.\", \\'In order to address this situation, you should develop a policy addressing gambling in the workplace and enforce it consistently.\\', \\'If you already have one in place, now would be a good time to send a communication to your employees reminding them of your policy.\\', \\'By reinforcing the rules you have in place that you believe are best for your business, you reduce the likelihood of any violations.\\', \\'As an easy solution to many of these problems, and recognizing that some segment of your workforce will want to have a stake in the outcome of the game, you may want to consider starting a voluntary workplace pool that requires no entrance fee.\\', \\'You can buy prizes with company funds and hand them out to the winners, turning what could be a problematic event into a morale booster.\\', \\'Days Leading Up The Game: Productivity And Dress Code Concerns Although many employers first think about gambling in the workplace when they consider the Super Bowl, they really should be thinking about the loss of productivity associated with the game.\\', \\'An estimate produced by the consulting firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas concluded that the work slowdown in the week before the Super Bowl costs American businesses close to $1.78 billion in lost productivity.\\', \\'Leading up to the game, sports fans in your office will be spending time online reading about the teams and texting their friends with their predictions instead of working.\\', \\'While it is helpful to create and enforce a policy restricting the kinds of activities that your employees can perform on business computers and company-issued smartphones, realistic employers know that most employees will easily be able to skirt these prohibitions by using personal smartphones and tablets.\\', \\'Instead, you should enforce productivity standards in the days leading up to the game just like you should be doing every other business day.\\', \\'Many companies recognize that their workers will inevitably spend part of their working day on personal business, whether it is running an errand, shopping online, making a phone call, or chatting with each other.\\', \\'Knowing this, most companies ultimately care about whether the assigned work is getting done, and will not micromanage every moment of the day.\\', \\'Ultimately and-especially in companies that employ mainly salaried employees—it is better to have happy employees (which will in turn make them more productive) rather than coming down harshly on an employee who has one or two relatively unproductive days before or after the Super Bowl.\\', \\'Of course, certain hourly workers and other employees have a responsibility not to steal time from you and will need to remain diligently working at all times they are on the clock.\\', \\'No matter your situation, just make sure to consistently enforce your productivity standards and associated policies.\\', \"Be realistic when addressing these situations, and make sure you don\\'t come down inordinately hard on one worker who may not be acting much differently than a coworker.\", \\'Inconsistent treatment is the gateway to a discrimination claim.\\', \"Finally, and especially if your offices are located in Southern California or New England, you may want to address your company\\'s dress code leading up to the game.\", \\'If you are going to allow workers to wear Jared Goff or Tom Brady jerseys, or otherwise dress in their team colors, make sure you are clear in your communications as to what types of team gear will be permitted; employees should understand that while they are encouraged to support their team, they should still dress in appropriate attire.\\', \\'Consider whether any safety-related concerns could arise depending on the type of work that your employees are conducting.\\', \\'The Week After The Game: Monday Morning Absences And Championship Parade Looking ahead to the day after the game, as well as the day of the championship parade, you should prepare for some inevitable absences, no-call/no-shows, and workers arriving late.\\', \"A recent survey on this subject found that approximately 16.5 million workers call in \\'sick\\' or use PTO the day after the Super Bowl, while another 4.4 million workers show up late.\", \\'And most employers know that unscheduled absences are far more costly to a business than planned time off.\\', \\'The ones who do show up are often distracted by water cooler chats, re-watching highlights from the game (or their favorite commercials), reviewing blogs and media stories about the biggest plays on the field, or nursing their hangovers.\\', \\'All of this adds up to diminished productivity.\\', \\'When it comes to the workers who do show up for work, make sure you enforce your productivity standards just like you did in the days leading up the game, allowing some realistic forbearance on Monday morning.\\', \"If you employ workers in jobs that include safety-related responsibilities, make sure to monitor them to make sure that the \\'case of the Mondays\\' isn\\'t a legitimate hazard that might require drug or alcohol testing or further investigation.\", \\'And if you happen to work in the city of the losing team, feel free to cut your workers some slack and let them wallow in misery for a few hours.\\', \\'As for the absent workers or the late-comers, you will want to enforce your attendance policies consistently.\\', \\'At the same time, you should keep in mind any state or federal leave laws that might protect absent workers or place administrative requirements on you before you take disciplinary action.\\', \"Where allowed, you should consider requiring \\'sick\\' employees to provide medical certification documenting the reasons for their absences, which may dissuade workers from trying to pull one over on you.\", \"If you operate in a state with a paid sick leave law, you should consult your state\\'s law to ensure that it does not restrict such a request.\", \\'Following these steps should allow you to sit back, relax, and actually enjoy the Super Bowl this year instead of worrying about the impact it will have on your workplace.\\']': 30.956559639692014,\n",

next to the big bowl of tortilla chips.', 'In front of the massive TV, the one tuned to the Super Bowl (commercials).', 'That guacamole at the Super Bowl party almost certainly began its journey as anavocado in Mexico, crossing one of the numerous bridges into the United States at either Pharr, Texas or nearby Laredo.', 'But, in the midst of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, there s one question worth asking: Did the avocados in that guacamole face the scrutiny of government inspectors, evenfurloughed ones ordered back to make that inspection without being paid?', 'Americans have long been dependent on imports for our clothing, our furniture, our phones, our appliances and more.', 'While toys and cars are notable exceptions, most of these imports don t run a great risk of harming us should something go awry.', 'Food is another matter, as is medicine.', 'Fromfood poisoning alone, 3,000 Americans die each year, 128,000 people end up in the hospital and 48 million get sick.', 'Not all of that is imported food, of course, but you get the idea.', 'Accidental prescription overdose deathsare a much bigger number, though, again, those are not all imports.', 'Although we continue to make significant advances in food and medicine inspection, including at our borders, we are at the same time becoming more dependent on food and medicine imports.', 'There are two primary reasons.', 'Price is one, as you might have guessed, particularly in the pharma space.', 'But a second is availability, a rarely mentioned benefit of increased trade.', 'We are no longer restricted to eating fresh fruits and vegetables seasonally, as was true a generation ago.', 'Today, most are available year round.', 'And it s big business.', 'Of the top 50 perishable imports featured in one of our 2018 publications,Perishables TradeNumbers, 48 totaled more than $1 billion in value.', 'Look no further for proof that the fresh guacamole just awaiting your tortilla chip.', 'The value of avocados, at $3.17 billion through October, the latest data available during the government shutdown, has more than doubled in just five years.', 'In that same time period, overall U.S. imports have grown 11.85%.', 'But it isn t justavocados and it isn t only fruits and vegetables from Mexico.', 'It is also fish fillets, which topped $5 billion in value through the first 10 months of 2018.', 'It is a total that puts the category on track to set a record for the 10th year in the last 15.', 'In the last five years alone, the value has increased by about one third.', 'Unlike avocados, which primarily come from one country, fish fillet imports increasingly come not just from Chile, a large salmon importer, but also from China, which is producing more and more tilapia for the U.S. market.', 'Those two countries alone account for about 50% of all U.S. imports.', 'Miami International Airport and the Port of Los Angeles account for an almost-identical 49% of the total imports, with most of the Chilean salmon coming through Miami and the Chinese tilapia through Los Angeles.', 'This is another challenge of keeping our imported food supply safe.', 'Although many communities around the country are theself-proclaimed kings of perishable trade, the truth is, many airports, seaports and border crossings all over the country play a critical role in the nation s food and medicine supply all of it with the potential to routinely make us happier and healthier but also, let s face it, kill us.', 'Forbananas, it is the Port of Delaware and the nearby, recently rechristened PhilaPort as well as, across the country, Port Hueneme, not too far from Los Angeles, and down south, the Port of Gulfport, Miss.', 'Total U.S. imports through October were valued at $2.06 billion.', 'The value is up more than 80% when compared to the same 10-month period in 2008.', 'Leading import passage forfresh beefinto the United States?', 'Sweetgrass, Mont.', 'The U.S. total through October: $2.53 billion.', 'That s 93.3% greater than the total in five years.', 'Leading import passage for one of the more dominant categories ofmedicines, largely in pill form?', 'Chicago s O Hare, with 11.18 billion of the $59.1 billion total.', 'But the top 11 accounted for more than $2 billion each through October.', 'The list includes six airports, three seaports and two border crossings.', 'They are in the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Deep South.', 'Over the last five years, when overall imports grew 11.85%, medicine imports climbed 51.29%.', 'While Mexico accounts for about half of all avocado imports, and while Chile and China account for about half of all fish fillet imports, it takes four countries to make up half of all of these medicine imports: Ireland, Switzerland, Germany and India.', 'More markets, more entry points, more complexity, much greater risk.', 'So, as you go to dip that tortilla chip into the guacamole, let me go out on a limb: You probably will feel a whole lot more comfortable with rigorous inspections by U.S. government workers, particularly ones collecting a paycheck and not worried about how to make the next month s rent or mortgage.', 'Pulling back on that guacamole?', 'Reaching for the shrimp cocktail?', 'Better than one in four chance if it was imported, andit almost certainly was, it came from India.', 'Almost half of the total from India entered the country at the Port of Newark, another 22% at the Port of Los Angeles and almost 9% at the Port of Miami.', 'Canada is also a large importer of shrimp and other crustaceans, with two Maine border crossings accounting for 84% of the total, at the border crossing in Houlton and the Port of Calais.', 'The Super Bowl might be as American as you can get.', 'But the furniture you will sit on, the TV that will showcase those commercials and the game itself, some of the food you eat, and maybe the medicine you will take to keep your blood pressure or

average audience since 2009.', 'Based on improved ratings this season, we can expect the audience for Super Bowl LIII to improve but fall short of the record (114.4 million viewers, set in 2015).', 'The big game, a clash in Atlanta between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams, will air February 3 on CBS.', 'Regular-Season Ratings: After a two-year ratings decline, the audience delivery of NFL games during the 2018 regular season grew by 5%.', 'Regular-season games on NBC, CBS, Fox and ESPN in 2018 averaged 15.8 million viewers, compared with just under 15 million in 2017.', 'Nonetheless, the audience delivery in 2018 was below the 2016 season s 16.5 million or the high-water mark, set in 2015 at 18.7 million.', 'The improvement in 2018 was across all four TV networks.', 'ESPN sMonday Night Footballpackage averaged 11.6 million viewers, an increase of 8% from the previous season.', 'On CBS, viewership grew 6%, averaging 16.5 million viewers.', 'On Fox, the average

eighth straight season (although the Sunday late afternoon games on Fox and CBS both averaged over 20 million viewers in 2018).', 'In calendar year 2018, 61 of the 100 most watched telecasts were live regular-season and postseason NFL games.', 'Wild-Card Weekend:The ratings improvement continued in the postseason.', 'The four playoff games during wild-card weekend averaged 28.4 million viewers, an increase of 12% from one year ago.', 'The highlight was the exciting Philadelphia Eagles victory over the Chicago Bears on NBC, which averaged 35.9 million viewers, making it the most watched wild-card game ever.', 'The three other wild-card games all reported audience increases from a year ago, led by the Saturday night prime-time game on Fox (Dallas Cowboys over the Seattle Seahawks), which averaged 29.5 million viewers, an increase of 29% from the previous year.', 'Divisional Round:Strong ratings prevailed in the divisional round.', 'The New Orleans Saints eliminated the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles, and the game averaged 38.2 million viewers, an increase of 7% from a year ago.', 'The Saturday night game on Fox featured the Los Angeles Rams and the Dallas Cowboys and averaged 33.4 million viewers, an increase of 25% from last year s game.', 'It was also the most watched Saturday night telecast in the history of Fox.', 'The remaining two games both averaged over 29 million viewers, with the New England Patriots lopsided victory over the Los Angeles Chargers delivering 29.2 million viewers, a drop of 7% from one year ago.', 'This was the only game in the

of 27.8 million viewers.', 'Conference Championships:The two conference championship games were played on January 20.', 'Despite controversies in both games, having both games involve the top two

from last year s NFC championship game, which started later in the day.', 'When audiences from Fox Deportes and the Fox Sports app are included, the average audience was 45 million.', 'The AFC

NFL has become exciting again.', 'Additionally, many marquee games were close (as witnessed by two overtime games in the conference championships), keeping viewers watching.', 'Also, the league addressed issues that had recently plagued it, including player national anthem protests and concussions.', 'With so many video choices available, increasing ratings in this fragmented video landscape is an achievement.', 'This will please the advertisers that are paying upwards of $5.3 million for a 30-second ad during Super Bowl LIII.', 'CBS is expected to sell over $500 million in commercial time during the game, or roughly half of what the network pays the NFL to televise an entire season.']\": 27.548743280546276,\n",

know, at five, six percent in January so far, eight percent year-over-year from \\'18 to \\'17 in terms of cash used and spending, and it\\'s very strong.\", \\'And then, unemployment is real low and wages are growing.\\', \"So, everything\\'s, you know, pretty good, it\\'s just slowing down a little bit.\", \"And everybody\\'s saying, oh, my gosh, that means it has to go here.\", \"It doesn\\'t.\", \"It\\'s just can slowdown.\", \"We\\'ll have a -- if it comes out the way it\\'s predicted, it\\'ll be the best year in growth other in \\'18 in seven years or something like that.\", \\'BARTIROMO: And you just reported an incredible fourth quarter, very strong, the consumer banking business is very profitable.\\', \"You\\'ve been able to report 16 straight quarters of positive operating leverage.\", \\'How do you keep that up if in fact we do see a bit of a slowdown?\\', \"MOYNIHAN: Well, it\\'s just hard work and the team does a great job.\", \\'But the real sort of thoughtful way it happens is the application of technology, to allow us to keep expenses relatively flat where revenues grow a little bit.\\', \\'And revenues grew -- operating (INAUDIBLE) growing faster and expenses, but revenues grew last year at three percent, four percent overall, something like that.\\', \\'Expenses were down a couple percent on affair basis.\\', \\'So, after tax reform.\\', \"And so, it\\'s very strong.\", \"But the way you do it is by applying technology, the way you do it is by applying efficiency, the way you do it by getting a line between you and the customer about services and capabilities, simplifying a place, taking out processes that don\\'t add value.\", \\'And we have 4200 ideas we put in place in the last three or four years to continue to make our company more effective.\\', \"The customer get a benefit off but the teammates get a lot of big benefit off, and how to just keep doing that, and it\\'s just hard work.\", \\'You have to plan multiple years ahead.\\', \\'We spent $3 billion on technology, a third of that goes to making the company better.\\', \\'BARTIROMO: And, what, $14 billion on overall technology in terms of employees, operations.\\', \\'MOYNIHAN: In operations.\\', \\'Yes, yes.\\', \"BARTIROMO: Now, I want to get to technology because I know you\\'re way ahead of your competitors on that.\", \"But let\\'s go through some of the business lines in the fourth quarter because it was quite impressive.\", \\'And I know consumer banking, the most profitable.\\', \\'When you look at the global markets business, capital markets in particular, we saw the quarter was tough for everybody with the markets the way they are.\\', \\'How do you improve the global markets profitability or is this even a business that you need to be in?\\', \"MOYNIHAN: Oh, no, it\\'s a big business for us.\", \\'We make -- in our markets business, we made like $3 or $4 billion after tax.\\', \\'We make -- last quarter, we made $500, 600 million -- 500 million, I guess it was.\\', \"But if you sort of think about it, we\\'re in the markets business because we\\'re good at it.\", \"But also we\\'re in it because it connects the issuing client, the company issuing bonds and the -- and the people buying bonds.\", \\'The (INAUDIBLE) stock and people buying stock.\\', \\'And then the research platform supports that and the wealth management business.\\', \\'So, the scale of the company allows us to be more efficient.\\', \\'So, those businesses, the fixed- income business, you know, had a tough December.\\', \"It really wasn\\'t a quarter.\", \\'Everybody forgets that coming out of November, everything was fine.\\', \\'And then, the lockdown.\\', \"BARTIROMO: Yes, it\\'s a good point.\", \"You\\'re right.\", \"MOYNIHAN: So, it was really a month, and it\\'s reverted back to more normalized now.\", \"But if you look at trading revenue for the last four years, it\\'s been sort of 13.1, 12.9, 13.1, 13.2 -- it\\'s been relatively stable.\", \\'We run the business for -- to move the money through the system to provide financing for the customers.\\', \"We don\\'t take -- we don\\'t take a lot, it\\'s just straight risk.\", \\'We try to keep the risk down.\\', \\'So, over the course of 10 years, the revenues have stabilized.\\', \\'The risk is way down.\\', \\'The numbers of people are down.\\', \"And we\\'re making probably twice as much money as we did back in the day.\", \"And so, it\\'s a great business.\", \\'BARTIROMO: Well, there you go.\\', \"Tell me about the market\\'s performance, though.\", \\'What do you think the markets are telling us?\\', \"I mean, we didn\\'t have any high-yield debt issuance at all in the month of December.\", \\'How long can the credit markets stay where they are before you get worried about that, and what are the markets telling us?\\', \"MOYNIHAN: Well, the market\\'s back open.\", \"And we\\'re doing a bond deal right now -- bonds for social purposes and things like that, and it\\'s well- received.\", \\'So, it was real -- December is really unusual.\\', \"And it was part because, frankly, people go to vacation in December, so there\\'s lot less activity.\", \\'And then you put a lot of the worry about the market.\\', \\'But if you ask me broadly, and you ask the experts, Chris (INAUDIBLE) and the team does wealth strategy and wealth management business.\\', \\'You know, they would basically say, look, the market instantaneous trying to pricing the uncertainty of the environment but is growth slowing down or is it stopping.\\', \"The whole political uncertainty around the world and they\\'re priced it in like instantaneously and risk, you know, came back off, and that high-yield moved out that demands of investors were for more yield.\", \\'It settles down and it will go back out and do it.\\', \"But it\\'s -- that happens once in a while.\", \\'It happened -- you know, and so, I think this thing -- as people -- because of the atmosphere potentially and the slowdown are overreacting to that.\\', \"And you\\'ve seen the market settle back down and absorb news of the day, and we\\'ll see what happens.\", \"BARTIROMO: Let\\'s talk about technology.\", \"Because you\\'ve become the leader in terms of digitization.\", \\'The iPhone obviously revolutionized so many industries.\\', \"Tell us what your customer can do at B of A with all of the money you\\'ve put into technology, and digitizing your business.\", \\'MOYNIHAN: Well, if you think about on the consumer side, which is easy, is for people to think all of this goes on on the institutional side.\\', \\'And so, on the consumer side, they have a wrench in their pocket.\\', \\'Anything you can do at a branch, you know, in a traditional banking sense or over the phone, you can do on your app.\\', \"And there\\'s 36 million digital users -- or 26 million mobile users who are not digital users, they don\\'t use a computer, growing at 10, 15 percent a year.\", \\'Sales are up over the 20 percent level, 25 percent of all sales are digital.\\', \\'Our digital mortgage product is growing.\\', \\'Our digital auto product is growing.\\', \\'But what you can do is everything.\\', \\'And then we have Erica.\\', \\'So, we have 5 million Erica users, it only started about a year or so ago.\\', \"And that\\'s people can just talk and ask questions, and it learns about you.\", \\'So, artificial intelligence, voice recognition program, that will basically say -- like, I was looking for a particular check and I said, did I get a check back from a tax authority on a refund, or did I get a deposit back I need to check.\\', \\'Yes, you got this back from New York State Tax Authority, or something like that.\\', \\'These are interesting things that change the nature.\\', \\'When you pay your bills, you just say I need to pay X, and it says, do you want to pay X?\\', \"Yes, here\\'s the amount.\", \\'So, think about how easy it is versus writing out checks or even going into bill payments.\\', \\'So, technology enables the consumers to do more faster, easier, half the checks we have are deposited via ATM.\\', \\'A little over 25 percent of deposits is by people taking pictures over the phone.\\', \"Think about that, if you drive to the ATM, put in -- if you take a picture, it\\'s the exact same activity, but you don\\'t have to go down -- and actually, think about, it\\'s environmentally more friendly if you don\\'t drive to the ATM or time savings.\", \\'And so, you can do everything.\\', \\'Interesting enough, where the application and the institutional side is getting interesting, too.\\', \\'So, believe it or not, corporate treasurers want mobile capabilities to be able to (INAUDIBLE) mobile initiate, you know, a $5 million wire with a mobile device sitting in a meeting with all the controls around it, and all the foreign currency and all that stuff.\\', \"It\\'s -- to me, it was always, really, they\\'re going to -- and absolutely, they want to do it because that\\'s the way they\\'re used to operate.\", \\'BARTIROMO: Does that mean you had to ramp up in terms of investment in cyber and protecting all of these data.\\', \\'MOYNIHAN: Yes, when I -- when I became CEO a decade ago, you know, almost now, this is my 10th year, I guess -- BARTIROMO: Congratulations.\\', \\'10 years, wow!\\', \"MOYNIHAN: It\\'s a survival.\", \"But it was a great time, and I\\'m looking forward to doing it for a long time more.\", \\'But if I -- if you think about it, I think we spent 200, maybe $300 million, we crossed over 700 this last year on it, and you know, we -- Cathy Bessant and the team worked on that, do a great job (INAUDIBLE) and they do a great job, 3,000 people, more or less.\\', \\'And we just have to be safe.\\', \"And by the way, as an industry, we work together with my colleagues across the industry to make sure our industry\\'s safe.\", \"And we\\'ve stayed ahead of the curve, knock on wood, we hopefully can.\", \\'BARTIROMO: So, fin tech, sort of nipping at your heels.\\', \\'Do you even have to acquire a fin tech company?\\', \\'Do you feel you have the scale or -- MOYNIHAN: We have a scale.\\', \\'We had a -- BARTIROMO: In terms of the digitization (INAUDIBLE) MOYNIHAN: We had a -- we had a 1-1/2 billion log-ins to our apps last quarter.\\', \\'This is not theoretical.\\', \\'BARTIROMO: 1-1/2 billion.\\', \\'MOYNIHAN: So just -- we are one of the larger digital companies.\\', \"We\\'re also one of the largest physical companies.\", \\'It takes both high tech -- high touch and high tech.\\', \\'Now, what do we learn?\\', \\'We always are a curious company.\\', \\'We have to stay curious, we have to think about things.\\', \"We\\'re always out there learning.\", \"So, when we go talk to fin tech companies or observe what they\\'re doing, more importantly, we\\'re trying to learn what does the customer see in that activity that they don\\'t see in our activity?\", \\'And then, how do we adapt that?\\', \\'So, a good example is about four years ago, because of the crisis and everything and the chargeouts we took in small business, we lengthened our small business approval process to like 20 days.\\', \\'And you -- if you think about four, five years ago, the advent of the -- you know, the mobile lenders and stuff like that, small business, they were, you know, 20 minutes.\\', \"Now, I\\'m not sure you can do it 20 minutes.\", \"I\\'ll leave that to next recession to test, but 20 days is too long.\", \\'So, we brought that back in by using this mobile apps and things like that.\\', \\'That united our small business.\\', \\'And we do more small business than most of the people in the world.\\', \\'BARTIROMO: So, what kind of a year would you expect when you look at small business, when you look at investment in terms of deals, M&A, and capital markets?\\', \\'What are you expecting?\\', \\'MOYNIHAN: Just talking to some of the teammates, the pipelines are decent in M&A.\\', \"And you\\'re seeing a lot of big deals and also the activity is solid and strong there.\", \\'I think when you think about small business -- interesting, the business community in the United States is very optimistic, still.\\', \"Even though they\\'re not as optimistic as they were at the highest point, which everybody points is still very optimistic on a relative basis.\", \"And our small business surveys, you know, late last fall and stuff were: we\\'re going to invest more, we\\'re going to hire more, we can\\'t get people -- those are the common themes.\", \"And so, I think it\\'s a good year for investment.\", \\'You know, as long as we solve a couple key issues.\\', \"We\\'ve got to get the shutdown down because it\\'s more -- the incremental impact of the workers and stuff is important, but it\\'s also just the process of getting approvals and stuff is being held up.\", \"We\\'ve got to get done, and then, ultimately, a trade situation has solved.\", \"That\\'s -- I\\'m not giving any news, everybody says that.\", \"But it\\'s time to get some of that stuff done.\", \\'BARTIROMO: What about the political environment?\\', \"You\\'ve got people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about 70 percent tax rates.\", \\'The Democrats, if they take the Senate in two years, does that mean heavier regulation?\\', \\'You know, what Elizabeth Warren wants to do with the banks?\\', \"MOYNIHAN: Well, if you think about our company when I -- when I get asked about this stuff -- is we\\'ve been around for some tough elections.\", \"That one in 1800 that they made the play about, we were here then, and we\\'ll be here for the next one.\", \\'So, it ebbs and flows in the United States.\\', \\'But at the end of day, a company like ours, it drives responsible growth, it delivers for our teammates, delivers for our shareholders, and delivers for the community.\\', \"So, we\\'ll be fine.\", \\'And then -- BARTIROMO: I have final question, Brian.\\', \"I know you\\'re up at the limit on deposits in the U.S., but as a global SIFI, can you acquire overseas, would you even want to acquire consumer lending abroad?\", \\'MOYNIHAN: We have -- outside the United States, we serve large companies and large investors.\\', \"That\\'s a business which is a global business.\", \\'We also bring U.S. mid-size companies to the world and things like that.\\', \"We have not yet seen any -- not that we\\'d acquire anybody because it\\'s not our strategy.\", \"We\\'re organic growth totally.\", \\'But that scalability concern businesses outside our country is at issue.\\', \"And so, we got out of the wealth management business outside of the United States because we basically had $1-1/2-billion revenue and didn\\'t make a penny.\", \\'And those resources could be better served to attack these market in the United States.\\', \\'We still have massive opportunity.\\', \\'BARTIROMO: How about a fin tech acquisition?\\', \"MOYNIHAN: There\\'d be no acquisitions.\", \\'We just work.\\', \\'(END VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: My thanks to Brian Moynihan, chairman and CEO at

latest where and when, coming up.\\', \\'And then, right here in Davos, the CEO of Coca-Cola is with me, James Quincey.\\', \"His take on the global economy and Coca-Cola\\'s business today.\", \\'Back in a moment.\\', \\'BARTIROMO: Welcome back.\\', \\'Live from the World Economic Forum here in Davos, Switzerland.\\', \"Coca-Cola is the world\\'s largest beverage company.\", \\'Its products are sold in over 200 countries and territories across the world.\\', \\'The company has more than 500 brands, some of the most familiar being Sprite, Dasani, Powerade, and of course, Coke Coca-Cola.\\', \\'At the helm of the company is CEO and Chairman-elect, James Quincey.\\', \\'And he is with me right now.\\', \\'Great to see you James.\\', \\'JAMES QUINCEY, CEO AND CHAIRMAN-ELECT, COCA-COLA: Nice to see you, too, Maria.\\', \\'BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.\\', \\'And one of the big themes here in Davos as you know is this coming slowdown in the economy.\\', \"You\\'ve got operations all over the world.\", \\'What are you seeing?\\', \\'QUINCEY: Yes.\\', \"We\\'re seeing the economy get a little bit slower, but I think we\\'re in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.\", \"It\\'s just a little bit slower growth.\", \"It\\'s not a recession or a decline.\", \\'So, we see - - we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tailwind than 2018.\\', \\'A lot of uncertainty and volatility around the world.\\', \"It is exactly how that will come out, but I don\\'t think we should talk ourselves into a problem.\", \\'And we ultimately as companies need to focus on what we control and what we can do to drive growth.\\', \"BARTIROMO: Let\\'s talk about what you\\'ve been doing because you\\'ve been expanding in all different categories in the nonalcoholic area.\", \"So, tell us what you\\'re expanding, where the growth is coming from in the coming years at Coca-Cola.\", \\'QUINCEY: Sure.\\', \"We\\'ll, we started out by, you know, coming out a period of refranchising and said, look, there\\'s a couple of truths about the consumer in the beverage industry.\", \"One, they\\'re drinking more commercial beverages, but two, they want more choice.\", \\'And we had not done enough to develop our portfolio and really follow the consumer.\\', \"So, we\\'ve been able to focus on sparkling, making them grow faster by focusing on some reformulations and innovation, bringing down the sugar, dial up Coke Zero and Diet Coke.\", \\'But then, get into the categories and most recently into some high-end sports drinks in the U.S., investing in -- investing in the coffee business and a whole series of portfolio expansions around the world.\\', \"BARTIROMO: You had to dial back the sugar because that\\'s what customers wanted, right?\", \\'QUINCEY: Yes.\\', \\'I mean, some people still want it, and it works for them to have classic Coke.\\', \\'But other people wanted less sugar.\\', \"And so, we\\'ve really dialed up and spent some money on R&D, getting Coke Zero sugar right, and revitalizing Diet Coke, which is a storied brand in the U.S. BARTIROMO: Tell me about the coffee business.\", \"That\\'s a crowded field.\", \\'QUINCEY: Yes, coffee is a big industry.\\', \"But the biggest (INAUDIBLE) of the coffee industry by far is selling coffee in someone else\\'s outlet.\", \\'The independent stores of all sorts of different shapes and sizes around the world sell coffee.\\', \"And who\\'s the biggest provider of beverages to those outlets?\", \\'We are.\\', \"So, there\\'s a tremendous opportunity for us to be a better beverage provider to millions of outlets around the world because we can help them with coffee as well as nonalcoholic ready to drinks.\", \\'BARTIROMO: Tell us about pricing.\\', \\'I know pricing came up at the last investor meeting.\\', \\'What has been the impact of your changes in pricing?\\', \"QUINCEY: Well, we\\'ve done a number of things on pricing.\", \"Yes, there\\'s been some cost inflation that came through in 2018, particularly in the U.S., driven by some of the challenges around the freight industry in the U.S.\", \"So, we\\'ve passed through cost increases, but we try to take an approach that\\'s not just passing through the cost, but really working intelligently on what\\'s the right price for each pack size, and to sometimes change the pack size so the consumer gets the price point they want and the amount that they want, and to really focus on the science of getting that right with an overall thrust of trying to move ourselves to more smaller packages.\", \\'BARTIROMO: Are you -- are you expecting to increase prices again?\\', \"QUINCEY: Yes, there\\'s some cost inflation coming through in 2019.\", \\'We expect to increase prices around the world.\\', \"Obviously, we\\'re in the business of selling through our customers.\", \\'And we want them to grow the beverage business faster than their business and to create value, so pricing will be a part of that.\\', \"BARTIROMO: Let\\'s talk about the Super Bowl.\", \\'This is always an important marketing event for your company.\\', \"The Super Bowl being held in your hometown of Atlanta this year, and you\\'ve got Pepsi trolling Coca-Cola ahead of the big game.\", \\'What are you going to do about it?\\', \\'QUINCEY: Well, I think our position is -- Atlanta is the most welcoming city in the U.S., so we are happy to see everyone come.\\', \"We hope it\\'s a great game.\", \\'And we hope they enjoy the City of Atlanta, which is our hometown.\\', \"And I think they\\'ll have a lot of fun.\", \\'BARTIROMO: Do you have plans for a big ad campaign around the Super Bowl.\\', \"QUINCEY: We do marketing all-year round, including we show spots at the Super Bowl, or just before the Super Bowl, and we\\'ll do something again this year.\", \\'But to all the noise, we just like to say we welcome everyone to Atlanta.\\', \"It\\'s a great place to come.\", \\'BARTIROMO: Tell us about the K-pop craze, Coca-Cola recently launching bottles and cans themed to the Korean boyband BTS.\\', \\'Seven different designs, one for each of the band members.\\', \\'This is a big brand right now.\\', \\'Recently, Mattel shares up after the announcement of a deal to create the BTS dolls.\\', \\'Why did you choose this route?\\', \\'It looks good -- great on the cans.\\', \\'QUINCEY: They look nice.\\', \"I think they\\'re going to work.\", \"It\\'s very -- it\\'s very Korean.\", \"But we\\'ve done a program around the world of trying to make our packaging interesting.\", \"It can (INAUDIBLE) whether it\\'s with the names on, or linking with some of the iconic -- the inconic figures like BTS and I think it\\'ll be really cool in Korea.\", \"BARTIROMO: Also, what you\\'ve done is this World Without Waste Initiative, a plan that\\'s very important to you, recycling of equivalent of every bottle or can of Coca-Cola sells -- that you sell by 2030.\", \"How\\'s it going so far, give us an update?\", \\'QUINCEY: Yes, so we said ourselves that our mission, get all the bottles back by 2030 and reuse half of them again ourselves in new bottles and cans.\\', \\'We made -- we made some good progress, we continue to collect more of our bottles back.\\', \"And we\\'re engaged with a lot of governments and NGOs and our peer companies.\", \\'I think this is only going to work if the manufacturers of sparkling drinks or water drinks get together, get with the retailers and get with the governments, and put in place a collection system that creates value.\\', \\'If the bottle has value, people will collect it one way or the other.\\', \\'And that will create the circular economy.\\', \"And I think we\\'re seeing good progress and good momentum coming into initiatives that\\'ll make this a reality.\", \\'BARTIROMO: Good for you and Coca-Cola.\\', \\'Thanks for doing that, James.\\', \\'QUINCEY: Thank you.\\',

that these bills are going forward and perhaps the government reopening is near.\\', \"CARTER: I\\'m not sure that the reopening is near because we\\'ve got two different strategies and we\\'re just not sure what\\'s going to happen.\", \"There\\'s really no incentive right now for the politicians to compromise.\", \\'When you look at what Americans are looking for, 53 percent are looking for people to stick to their promises rather than compromise.\\', \"So, we\\'ve got two different bills out there.\", \"They\\'re proposing two different things.\", \"I don\\'t see any movement for them to come to the middle and say that it\\'s worth compromising.\", \"And on top of that, you\\'ve got Republicans, 82 percent support the wall, 93 percent of Democrats oppose the wall.\", \\'So, what are you supposed to do?\\', \"Leaders are supposed to lead, they\\'re supposed to persuade folks of their position.\", \"We don\\'t see any of that happening right now.\", \"People are digging in into their silos, it\\'s getting to be more and more tribal.\", \"And I\\'m not sure that I see any of the leadership coming out there, and saying let\\'s reach across the aisle and bring people along for the ride, so we\\'re going to get people to come -- you know, come together.\", \"There\\'s no one who\\'s doing that.\", \"And I think it\\'s really, really sad.\", \\'BARTIROMO: Dagen, how do you see it?\\', \"I feel like they\\'ve got to open it soon.\", \\'You know, at the end of the day, leadership must prevail.\\', \"What\\'s your take?\", \"DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It\\'ll be really interesting to see how these votes go in the Senate.\", \"So, there are two plans, the President Trump\\'s plan, the Republicans will put up which has $5.7 billion for barrier and border security funding, included in it, the three year protection for the DREAMers.\", \\'On the Democrat side, it is a measure that will fund the government through February the 8th.\\', \\'So, the Democrats would need to come up with to get to that 60-vote mark, need to come up with essentially 13 Republicans.\\', \"But again, Republicans are hearing from their constituents and hearing from people in the government and they\\'re more and more worried about the knock-on effects in their districts, in this economy, where people aren\\'t getting paid.\", \"You\\'ve heard from the FBI organization, the head of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, more and more they\\'re concerned.\", \\'If, however, I should point out, if something happens with the Democrats paying just to fund the government through early February, President Trump has essentially vowed to veto that.\\', \\'So, more and more heat is owning the shutdown.\\', \"And I\\'ll add this, if he gets in front of the American people and is not in front of both Houses of Congress next week and gives his speech, again, that\\'s an exclamation point on him claiming ownership of this shutdown that more and more Americans are feeling.\", \"BARTIROMO: Well, she doesn\\'t want to have the shutdown in the House of Representatives, now there\\'s talk that maybe he\\'ll go to Ohio, do it in a rally-style fashion.\", \"MCDOWELL: Well, that -- and that -- well, then he shines a spotlight on the fact that it\\'s his shutdown and nobody else\\'s.\", \\'CARTER: But I think the thing is, right, you look at this, and a lot of people are placing blame on Trump.\\', \"And that\\'s what you\\'re talking about.\", \"Six in 10 Americans don\\'t approve of the way the President is handling the shutdown.\", \"But fully five in 10 Americans aren\\'t approving of the way Democrats are handling it either.\", \"And so, it\\'s not like people are looking to saying like it\\'s all the President\\'s fault and the Republicans are doing it so wrong, they\\'re looking it both sides, saying, guys, get it together because neither -- like 70 percent of Americans are saying, we don\\'t support the shutdown at all.\", \"So, someone\\'s has got to be the bigger person.\", \\'Now, if the President goes out there and talk somewhere else, maybe he is going to set out a strategy and rise above it.\\', \"He is putting forth compromise and maybe we\\'ll start seeing him getting some credit for that.\", \"BARTIROMO: And we\\'re looking at the next pay period coming very soon, another pay period missed.\", \"I

that are being used.\\', \\'Tell us about that.\\', \\'How significant is that and how do they work?\\', \"DUDLEY: Well, it\\'s a processing, you know, so many petaflops of data can be done.\", \\'You

very high tech as well.\\', \\'Tell us about that.\\', \\'DUDLEY: Well, you can go down and drill wells now that come out like six and nine times off of a single well, to penetrate layers of rock.\\', \\'I mean, the Permian Basin may be essentially the largest oil field in the world.\\', \\'It was sort of forgotten for a long time and left.\\', \\'Technology breakthroughs by small companies back in

the oil and gas climate initiative, we take this seriously.\", \"The world, it can\\'t be erased of renewables.\", \\'It has to be erased to reduce emissions.\\', \"And so, we\\'re doing all kinds of things on that front.\", \\'BARTIROMO: So, knowing all of that, take a look at the market for us.\\', \"We\\'ve got investors out there, a little perplexed on what\\'s going on with oil prices over the last 12 months.\", \\'Is the market getting it right?\\', \"What\\'s your sense?\", \"DUDLEY: Well, I think the market -- I don\\'t think the volatility in the last six months is hard to explain, really.\", \"In June, the OPEC groups -- OPEC plus group got together and said sanctions on Iran, it\\'s going to shoot the oil price up.\", \\'So they agreed to increase production.\\', \"And then, there were waivers granted and that dropped the -- that dropped the price, and now too much, they\\'ve overshot and may have increased production a little bit.\", \"I think it\\'s actually the market working pretty clearly.\", \"I think it\\'s been, maybe, surprising political signals that have made it move so fast.\", \"But I think the market\\'s coming into balance the first quarter of the
